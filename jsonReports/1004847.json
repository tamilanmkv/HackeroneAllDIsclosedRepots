You will be given a link like grabify.link/XXXXXX, this is required for the Proof-Of-Concept to function correctly, just click the copy button and move on to the next step.\n\nExecute the Proof-Of-Concept and input the URL you copied, you will then be asked for an amount of seconds to wait between each request, I personally would choose 5, since it's only proving it (There will be more time between each request because the server has to send the request, process and send it back before the code will continue).\n\nThe Proof-Of-Concept will print out any error codes the system sends back, there should be none. If there is a message, stop the code and make sure you have copied the URL and pasted it correctly, including the protocol and no slash at the end of the URL. (When the code says `Fault string returned: ` followed by a blank string, it means there is no error)\n\nAfter it has printed a few links, go the grabify tracking page in your browser, scroll down and see the logged IPs, you may need to refresh your browser and ensure you didn't enable the toggle to stop bots showing up.\n\nI have attacked a Proof-Of-Concept on how this can be abused and screenshots.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can use this to get some idea of the internal network infrastructure or use it in co-ordination with other WordPress web sites to conduct a DDoS on a target","weakness":{"id":68,"name":"Server-Side Request Forgery
