The gh_jid URL parameter is used to load the correct form in the iframe. HTML characters are escaped, but using semicolons you can inject URL parameters into the iframe via the gh_jid parameter to load any job form on the page.\n\nHere's an example job page: https://status.im/our_team/open_positions.html?gh_jid=2385338\nAnd the iframe that loads within it: https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?for=status72\u0026token=2385338\u0026b=https%3A%2F%2Fstatus.im%2Four_team%2Fopen_positions.html\nYou cannot just add a \"for\" parameter to the job page URL because it will not pollute into the iframe, however by using a semicolon you can pollute it since it is passed with the gh_jid parameter.\n\nHere's an example of polluting it: ```https://status.im/our_team/open_positions.html?gh_jid=2223984;for=remitly``` (I put it in a code block so the semicolon is not URL encoded; for impact purposes, note that on most messaging platforms it's not encoded)\nAnd the iframe that loads: https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?for=status72\u0026token=2223984;for=remitly\u0026b=https%3A%2F%2Fstatus.im%2Four_team%2Fopen_positions.html is clearly a job form from a different company.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Take a valid job page URL, ex. https://status.im/our_team/open_positions.html?gh_jid=2385338\n2. Get a different Greenhouse form gh_jid and corresponding company \"for\" value and put them in the URL with  a semicolon like so: ```https://status.im/our_team/open_positions.html?gh_jid=2223984;for=remitly```\n\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n#367589 is a similar report by me in which an iframe can be polluted, leading to content injection.\n\nA crucial part that a lot of companies misconceive about this is that it's a Greenhouse problem. It is actually a problem with your implementation of Greenhouse. This issue was brought to Greenhouse's attention already and they have made a new implementation that opens jobs in a separate tab rather than an iframe. This mitigates the issue entirely.\n\nThis is what the page looks like with an external job form loaded:\n{F1041291}\n\n## Suggested Mitigation\n\n  1. Hot Fix: Remove open positions page? Not sure if there's really a quicker fix than either options below. You could also just make it redirect to the status.im job listings on Greenhouse.com.\n  2. Medium Term: Filter out semicolons from URLs, e.g. redirect home when a semicolon is present in the URL. This would prevent pollution of external job forms.\n  3.  Long Term: Implement Greenhouse's new integration that doesn't use iframes. This updated version can be seen on many sites now such as [Github](https://github.com/about/careers).\n\nIf you provide a detailed and working mitigation in the Suggested Mitigation section, your submission might become eligible for a bonus.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could sign up for Greenhouse as a 1-person company, create a phishing job form that looks like the user has been logged out and asks them to log back in or any other method to steal user data. Other forms fit seamlessly into the page so no stylistic error would expose this as a phishing form. This essentially can be leveraged in the same way as stored XSS with the attacker being able to provide a link to their own content on Status.im.","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":1041291,"file_name":"b53e126dfae85bd210ec8494f59b0ad7.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/oMyJB9497X9CYNc6nn3jftPQ?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22b53e126dfae85bd210ec8494f59b0ad7.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27b53e126dfae85bd210ec8494f59b0ad7.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ4NIHB2M2%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T131639Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIE3FUcgRK7FM%2F7U9PAkh6%2BI7wZViD1MP1Y8qZWLRN1eUAiAgc4SQu0yGJV%2BOQRn82JsTD2%2Bd2fHZQycxL60pz%2B7CjyqDBAjt%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMkR9JAvrXeOfq9Rc6KtcDp5bGOpV6FTgydp%2FZOb6Bh6HFPtwnCVZfa015OiSuBfCxPwur%2F7aSPKTNE0sy0w9C45qL0zZ1nOQQos0M24uDH67J2wRZXM50ImEA29W1ENYnCggW3Oj1ThbKF4WgRsg%2F9mjcm%2BZmkVxvLoYJ9V%2BPAToGVUPNdCuARshEYKICR0Xo5x6JoDNaCt8Ld9eGqOBMXV3rned7uAPh8EmsbYJGE3kgeYkoAT36Qaqe4UgPgyO9VFwa9aDWRX%2B50CKWSjbjZzr%2BF%2B9jH4MB%2FxFZ4EWRHEor6ZAw08vWfwqAZLqqZdMNm9vuS82Y9DrOKW2mwiXSVAN3ddQvsOMXsKnTXkUhnfuaQmZvTtYFFm%2BIF8eMq92q4rbYHzak7PfNtWyYQ5raA9JIgznaWFJzJX%2BJlzu%2Bu3r2q3jjPLUM80AxozLcRqWVvYBpiIJlFx45cKPkX%2F2%2BeKoncWc%2B6ePWFPme30ZUDKqp6naa4cEDN31MhQC6Orokr1YD%2FJvOnl4SUarbB1%2BVgfPNBbXbzGIn%2BQ51fempHBLdSWygAxQb8EgPDJYVXZxvBJySlPreu1xMH98Dq97W1%2FcRuSdU1ytWMJPT5MEKol3iFlX9S3vBhB4zpCiL0Qjhs8rBVdayMKLXkIsGOqYB2%2BJTBbMxNO8iefRZNNANeiPRoGrUFs7jVSy6MeL55bB1oEjsBrS1ldm2HFxpIsKxeGY%2Fw5R4r6d07DNpzBAlMx0mvj%2FrMVfwHZDUaLkkIW7L5kfZJyauAUQfU1Yr9%2Flzl1bTl9jiK08pDtPhZS7%2FjLscylmOg0jy%2BlazgeqN9hRW54AGkI6XkZty9qqJMe%2BYbSVGEfkYqEbJxp7dv5pFW%2Ftu9oswsQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=8646f42efb58a0d38e0bcc23cbc4d65ec9dd89fdaa9aaff17a4e3c8d96b37cae","file_size":38385,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2021-03-08T20:24:04.637Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-18723154.67782635,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":10,"voters":["th4nu_0x0","nikitastupin","ali","dmc3","salahhasoneh","jackb898","ning1022","cryptographer","d3dezio","pandey_alex"],"structured_scope":{"databaseId":20475,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://status.im/","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9564603,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @jackb898,\n\nThank you for your submission.
