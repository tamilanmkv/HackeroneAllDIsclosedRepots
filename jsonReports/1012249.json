In this case, the vulnerable URL is ████ and the vulnerable parameter is the POST keyword parameter. \n\n##Reproduction steps\n\n1 - Perform a new search request and intercept the resulting request with a interceptor proxy (for example, using Burp).\n2 - Use the following payload for the POST keyword parameter.\n\n```\n\u003ca+href=\"ja%0A%0Dvascript:alert(document.domain)\"\u003eClick\u003c/a\u003e\n```\n\nThe above payload  also allows to bypass the WAF present on the server.\n\n3 - A new link called \"Click\" will be shown on the resulting webpage. A click on the link will trigger the payload execution.\n\n## Impact\n\nDepending on the severity of the vulnerability, user cookies could be stolen enabling an attacker to abuse accounts,or webpage content could be modified tricking users to surrendering their personal data, but possibilities are endless. In this case, my PoC shows an innocuous popup containing the execution scope of the vulnerability.","weakness":{"id":61,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":8,"voters":["nafisaqil","sadiqali999100","vxresearch","plook","yasith","lollollollol","elz2204","makach-mouchkil"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9569627,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
