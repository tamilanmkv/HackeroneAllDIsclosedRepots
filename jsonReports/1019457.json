Not every time though.  Issues might vary based on number of cores/threads present or allocated to the test system. For this testing using a VirtualBox VM with 3 vCPUs running up to date Ubuntu 20.04.\n\n\nI received the following errors over various runs with the helgrind tool.  Usually the initial few logged output lines will report some failure, rarely do the later output logged lines show failures.  Some examples of errors received over various runs:\n\nR: 16 - Error in the HTTP2 framing layer \u003chttps://www.microsoft.com\u003e\nR: 16 - Error in the HTTP2 framing layer \u003chttps://www.google.com\u003e\nR: 35 - SSL connect error \u003chttps://www.mysql.com\u003e\n\nR: 52 - Server returned nothing (no headers, no data) \u003chttps://www.bbc.co.uk\u003e\n\nR: 55 - Failed sending data to the peer \u003chttps://www.google.com\u003e\n\n\n$ valgrind --version\nvalgrind-3.15.0\n\n\nWhen not running under helgrind the 10-at-a-time binary usually runs without issues, but sometimes one will randomly fail, which might be normal sometimes, but appears to validate that this is a real problem and not only revealed with libcurl used under helgrind.\n\nR: 35 - SSL connect error \u003chttps://www.hp.com\u003e\n\n\nHave not tried c-ares library.  Would you find it useful if I did?\n\n\nNot clear if the problem is with libcurl or with the libc library implementing getaddrinfo().\n\n## Impact\n\n- Failure to connect to target system.\n- Connecting to wrong IP if DNS data corrupted, potentially disclosing sensitive data to wrong site.\n\n\nMitigation:\n- Limit parallel DNS usage.\n- Potentially c-ares library may not have this issue, but this is not verified.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information

built curl with --disable-threaded-resolver and the helgrind data race reports have gone away, but interestingly two of the sites (google and mysql) are still consistently failing now and another one (hp) fails from time to time.   As if helgrind is changing the dynamic of the execution so much that it results in these two failures.  Helgrind is famous for slowing down execution of code, so that is not a surprise, but could it be so slow as to cause the server to fail the client connection.\n\nAttaching log to show the failures when the libcurl code was built with --disable-threaded-resolver flag.

As long as proper locking primitives are used then the helgrind report should be reliable.\n\nThere is a long discussion in this document: https://www.valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html\n\nHere is a small subset of the discussion in section 7.5 of the document above:\n\n\"Make sure your application, and all the libraries it uses, use the POSIX threading primitives. Helgrind needs to be able to see all events pertaining to thread creation, exit, locking and other synchronisation events. To do so it intercepts many POSIX pthreads functions.\n\nDo not roll your own threading primitives (mutexes, etc) from combinations of the Linux futex syscall, atomic counters, etc. These throw Helgrind's internal what's-going-on models way off course and will give bogus results.”\n\n\n\n3- Looking over the valgrind reported events, it seems to me that the problem might very well be deep inside the getaddrinfo() call in the libc library.  So there may be nothing that can be done from the libcurl side.  Right now, I would have to dig further into the dns resolver code to have a better understanding of the issue and what exactly could be impacted by the data race.  Sorry I jumped the gun and should have dug more before reporting.\n\nRegarding the comment about reorganizing the url list causing problems to disappear, that now seems to be not related to this dns issue, but some other issue uncovered regarding openssl when running really slowly due to helgrind.  I would need to investigate that and could end up as some issue with the openssl library, most likely has nothing to do with libcurl.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-29T16:46:39.356Z","updated_at":"2020-10-29T16:46:39.356Z","actor":{"username":"brumbrum","cleared":false,"url":"/brumbrum","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"curl","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9674743,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"As a test, I'll try to use c-ares instead of the glibc dns resolver.

B) we've had the threaded resolver for over 15 years and we've shipped curl with the threaded resolver enabled by default for over three years and not once (during the last decade at least) have we gotten reports about curl connecting to the wrong IP address or having crashed in the name resolver thread.

When I encountered it it was due to two threads not being synchronized and sometimes things happening in different order leading to random behaviors.   As the problem is only easily seen while using helgrind leads me to think that it is a performance based issue.\n\nThese errors are most likely NOT due to dns threaded resolver; and are SSL/TLS related instead. \n\nSo we have two issues mixed together.  Hopefully I did not confuse matters here.\n\nDo you feel this SSL/TLS problem deserves more attention and might be the more important issue to resolve?  I'm thinking it is. Might be a rare problem with parallel downloads.  Any one else report random problems in parallel mode, while using SSL/TLS? \n\n\n2B- I found these old posting that I think you got it right back 10 years ago.\n\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-12/0117.html\nhttps://curl.haxx.se/mail/lib-2010-12/0140.html\n\nFrom what I can gather reading various other posts, glibc developers use a lot of special optimizations and I think that helgrind can not be fully trusted to deal with them reliably.  Also helgrind has a suppression file that attempts to deal with the false positives, and there are a number of glibc suppression entries in there.  Seems likely that they should add at least one more entry for the getaddrinfo() call.  \n\nSuppression file on my system is at: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/valgrind/default.supp\n\nAttaching my copy of default.supp to this comment.  In it you can see various suppression for libc and glibc.\n\nUsing a very simple multi-thread test tool that calls getaddrinfo() once per thread, I was able to generate similar helgrind reports, where it is very obvious that if there is a problem it must be in glibc or helgrind is reporting a false positive.\n\nI agree with you that I have not seen any actual bad behavior that can clearly be related to getaddrinfo() so yes, this is looking more like a false alarm.\n\nPlease accept my apologies for this.\n\n\n2C- As far as I can tell curl is not doing anything wrong with the function calls.  In fact using getaddrinfo() is the correct thing to do when used the resolver in a multi-threaded application.  Problem is most likely helgrind not being able to deal in a reliable way with glibc getaddrinfo().  False positive seems like the right call until better proof can be found.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-30T01:07:09.915Z","updated_at":"2020-10-30T01:07:09.915Z","actor":{"username":"brumbrum","cleared":false,"url":"/brumbrum","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"curl","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9677099,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Forgot the my suppression file.

In some other tests I also used the 'cpulimit' tool to only limit the 10-at-a-time process CPU availability, with similar success in reproducing the issue. As I am using a VM I also did some of the testing with a single vCPU allocated to the VM.\n\nAlso if I changed the multi_setopt option CURLMOPT_MAXCONNECTS to a larger number, then the problem got worse as the number was further increased, as the share of the CPU needed to manage each of the additional connections was reduced, leading to more failures being triggered.\n\nI looked at the traffic with wireshark,, after some specific times (5, 10, 15, 20 seconds) the server end is returning packets with FIN/ACK.  Many times the RST/ACK (connection reset) is also seen coming from the server.  Suggesting that the remote end is timing out and shutting down the communication.
