It is used for login, forgot password, and administrators viewing user information.\n\nUnfortunately, this endpoint lacks basic security precautions, the most serious of which appears to enable database scraping via ███ (I assume this is for ████████).\n\nBy entering sequential and numerical user IDs via the UID parameter, an unauthenticated and unauthorized external attacker can scrape the ████████ database's emails, ████ info, ████████ scores, and first \u0026 last names.\n\n## Impact\nAn unauthenticated, unauthorized external attacker can obtain the full names, emails, military branches, and ████ scores of all users registered in the █████ (███) system.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Run the following cURL command: `curl 'https://███'  --data-raw 'sendingForm=██████' `\n\n2. Success.\n\n## Other Notes\nThis ██████████ endpoint appears extremely insecure in general. There is a very verbose ASPX error if you enter sendingForm with any number greater than ██████ and don't specify a UID. There is a null user/UID in the system with UID █████████, which will be matched against whenever not entering a parameter (i.e. excluding \"un\" and \"pn\" during login on ███).\n\nI suspect more damage is possible with this endpoint, but as I have already unintentionally and accidentally extracted information on UID █████████(which is not me), I am reporting the vulnerability now and ceasing penetration █████████ing against the endpoint.\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n1. Ensure that sendingForm type ████████ can only be utilized by logged in administrative users.\n2. Ensure that a null parameter in any form does not evaluate to \"true\" (so only specifying a username without a password does not lead to a successful login).\n████████. Disable ASP verbose error generation.\n4. Given how central ████ appears to be, and that it contains information on tens of thousands of students, perform an audit of the source code. It does not appear to use any best practices.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn unauthenticated, unauthorized external attacker can obtain the full names, emails, military branches, and █████ scores of all users registered in the ███ (███) system.\n\nAn adversarial intelligence agency could obtain information on students participating in DOD ██████ instructional programs.","weakness":{"id":55,"name":"Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":7,"voters":["skarsom","ayoub0x1","0nlymohammed","dastan_9408","samsondeen","ekgaribadmi","meispi"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9980133,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
