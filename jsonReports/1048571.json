Any individual can execute requests on these endpoints without authorization nor authentication. These include the ability to view ████\n\nSome of these endpoints are legitimately used in the ██████████ of the website, such as the one to ███████.\n\n## Impact\nAn external, unauthorized, and unauthenticated attacker can scrape data of █████ by date on the ██████.\n\nAn external actor may also be able to perform injections against the database service through maliciously crafted attacks.\n\nAn external, unauthorized, and unauthenticated attacker can perform a stored XSS attack using on an ████████. \n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\nData Extraction:\n███████. Navigate to https://█████████.\n████. Navigate to the \"██████\" ████ (https://████?████████████)\n3. Enter the year ███████████████████████████████, the month █████████████, and the day █████████████, then press Invoke.\n4. Success (█████████).\n5. For further extraction, take one of the user IDs present in the JSON reply and paste it into the ███ ███████ (https://██████████?███████████).\n6. For further extraction, take one of the profile IDs present in the JSON reply and paste it into the █████████ ██████ (also set \"dbName\" to \"███\") (https://█████████?███████). \n\nStored XSS/Information Modification:\n███. Navigate to the ███████ █████████ (https://█████████?███).\n██████. Parameters: dbName = `██████████`, OUid = `█████████`, lngDesc = `████████`, modDesc = `███████`, wrkPLid = `███████`, clngPLid = `██████`, prfDate = `████████████/█████████/██████████████████████ ███████████████████:█████████████:███████████████████`, timeString = `Tue Dec ████████████ ██████████8:█████9:56 ███████████████████████████`, prfLink = `demofromskarsom`, CData = `\u003ciframe onload=\"alert(██████)\" style=\"display:none\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e`, sessionID = `██████`\n3.
