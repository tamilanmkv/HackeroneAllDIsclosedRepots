This endpoint also provides the ability to view information that may be FOUO, to exfiltrate information on registered personnel or contractors, to upload files, and to change configuration settings with ███████████████ privileges.\n\n**Description:**\nThe IP address ███ points to a deployment of an application called ████/█████, which is a DoD-owned system on █████████). The login for this deployment accepts insecure ███ credentials (███).\n\nThere is also an authentication/█████ panel accessible at https://██████████externally accessible with these credentials.\n\nThe ████████ system available through this login includes file upload features, data exfiltration and management, workspace management, and infrastructure management.\n\nThe ██████████ / authentication █████████istration system available through this login includes file import/export privileges, user management, RBAC management, HTTP header management, OAuth credential management, session management, and frankly anything else you can think of that would be in an ████████ panel.\n\n████████ frontend:\n#███████\n#██████\n#█████\n\n███████ backend:\n#███\n#█████████\n#█████\n#██████\n#██████\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n1. Navigate to https://████\n2. Enter the username \"██████\" and the password \"██████████\"\n3. After logging in, click \"Launch\" under ██████\n4. Navigate to https://███████████\n5. Enter the username \"███\" and the password \"█████████\"\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\n████████████\n███\nBuild Date: 25 November 2020\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n1. Immediately disable insecure ███████████████ credentials.\n2. I would recommend preventing external access to the ████████ █████████ portal/requiring CAC as a best practice.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn unauthorized attacker can exfiltrate intelligence and personnel information stored in a staging █████/█████.\nAn unauthorized attacker can modify, insert, and delete intelligence and personnel information stored in a staging ████████/███████.\n\nAn unauthorized attacker can exfiltrate, modify, upload to, download from, and/or deny access to a staging ██████ environment through the ██████ ████ panel. \n\nI did not feel comfortable seeing whether I could escalate file uploads to an RCE before getting DOD consent.","weakness":{"id":87,"name":"Insufficiently Protected Credentials"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":4,"voters":["skarsom","dastan_9408","mattharkonnen","blck_sxmuraii1999"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10019321,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
