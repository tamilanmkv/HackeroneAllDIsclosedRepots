Name [this one is interesting and our point of focus]\n2. Email\n3. Password\n\nI filled up Email, Password field and while filling up Name field i noticed the client-side javascript was filtering out /,[],etc \n\nI was able to bypass that filter by intercepting request of registration using   BurpSuite and adding restricted character like / in name field  in  this scenario whereas others characters  might be used too!\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n1. Go to https://my.stripo.email/cabinet/#/register\n2. Fill our Name,Email and Password field and intercept that request with burp suite\n3. In request change \"Name\" value to https://google.com/\n4. After doing that forward request and login with credentials!\n5. You have to complete the setup-wizard in order to get access to account! but the victim won't be able to as the server doesn't accept invalid characters in name field resulting in permanent DOS!\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\nI have provided STRIPO.mkv as video POC where the same things have been explained and demonstrated!\n\n## Impact\n\nThe attacker might target single/multiple new user and reproduce this bug in order to DOS their account permanently and also this makes their mail unusable for your service and they have to use new mail in order to use your service","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial of Service"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":1114073,"file_name":"STRIPO.mkv","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jq2pdd9i5ak06m9e3mx91q2psssb?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22STRIPO.mkv%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27STRIPO.mkv\u0026response-content-type=video%2Fx-matroska\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQUJKC7J4R%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T132011Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHQaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIC49ArTf3LAqriZd1Lwuq3I3uKt0W5qVVJhzIQib1O0YAiEAotLNlyUZMk18dOsDs4rZgwa1HC%2F97I0ZOQY2G5rwxRcqgwQI7f%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDOvtFvz4a8x633onlirXAzPXQ2%2F5YIwHif4VZsTaZh1gaGvxJeaFfMEHhYDER%2B09WJ0UTquyO7zM97bGLeSh46E3SyxDMje5%2FZ1U4wOO3hNE7QSYJojnrJK0sSAfm%2FVN9xgjYZv6HVpRWB3jc3mwY%2B87if3SlFkJYLumzbO5csxhDwtJ5WXU2mBz%2BQpO4qmKmR1lYVtBXNgruWvdNx5Qr5NLYq8Dl0syzp3QEqDeyJ5bql6lJJXY%2B6gcXsqDkf1%2BWqBm20iQWJnylJSrj9ffHZ1N3GfFKi5fgBOsveTb2Nob8UEwpMjzno0A3qJe0k%2F3DbN3ERjTaoR8jh%2FcOreKCfIL06Pdqzi6JIgjRpc4vZGfpq6TcXLEDI5TfIPHc4C1APAJAFIPq%2Bt9d4F0XmZy91VzSHcign0uVhqRnorxP75Vq4KBj7L0FyzIIDFWy80jtXCeju4Q0MVc2rlvWAlOueRA41BrhpuFfOJIGimciTYiE0auGnlylur%2F%2BQ5FOxirMX%2Bby6J2W4a%2BsQ8IMgUa7xoY%2BEsgg46CsRxOVXQDq9wvd8dKWTSYFrnP5T0l86h38M8e5JTP%2FzTJyV4%2B5bl9IuNvlNvpmOvx%2FAygxKS65pEFeEX2CvdZovhe3nX4Yg%2BuSOWdcjonxzD10JCLBjqlAfx6d5oYSQZ1X773otHyNqfHvq26hlTf%2BofuB5ezB8Ga6rKCSh8RrGaRokw2oqsgLT5xkbRFpwX%2BJWXGVN3zaKcdQzS6endZ0h0tWr1Dxod7DTG5J%2B5HvZtfAaI5y6BclbNEvfcEyp5ZiX1lHeXJlsILocXuPZCkmxl%2B2UZzZH4tf13l8EldI699gp%2Be2oh6PcYIdSUDfnHtZAenLKh56KfVA3uM6Q%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=510cf07d44dbd4fe37d436cd0f2764ec0bfa9e1d84700fad0c257547aadbc78b","file_size":108769814,"type":"video/x-matroska"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":9,"voters":["mr-medi","drsniper","bibekshah","akashhamal0x01","iamcoolcat","cloufish","roy6900","cufflio","rutrut"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":38702,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"my.stripo.email","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10096184,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Please suggest a mitigation.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-12-14T12:44:03.355Z","updated_at":"2020-12-14T12:44:03.355Z","actor":{"username":"artem_nefedov","cleared":false,"url":"/artem_nefedov","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"stripo","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10096238,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"first solution: the other solution looks like hard but for now i can say allow  special characters and filter by different tricks like html encoding and others in order to prevent other web attacks like xss,etc \n\nsecond solution:  the second way is validating name at backend too!\n\n in this scenario u guys are validating name by client side javascript and it can be bypassed as seen in this report!
