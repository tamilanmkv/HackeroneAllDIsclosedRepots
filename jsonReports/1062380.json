If we search something, the value is reflected and not properly sanitized. For example if we search `██████████/search/node/chron0x` we can see in the javascript code:\n```javascript\n[...]\n\u003cscript\u003e\n\t//Early marking that the browser supports javascript\n\ttry {\n\t\tdocument.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].classList.add(\"js\");\n\t} catch(E) {\n\t\tdocument.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].className += \" js\";\n\t}\n\tvar rootN = \"https://████/████\";\n\tvar whoisURL = \"/█████████\";\n\tvar eventTitle = \"\";\n\tvar ████; //Whether the person is on the receiving end of chats\n\tvar internalPath = 'search/node/chron0x';\n\u003c/script\u003e\n[...]\n```\nDue to improper input sanitization, this is vulnerable to XSS. Inserting the payload `';alert('chron0x');'` into the search field leads to\n```javascript\n[...]\n\u003cscript\u003e\n\t//Early marking that the browser supports javascript\n\ttry {\n\t\tdocument.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].classList.add(\"js\");\n\t} catch(E) {\n\t\tdocument.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].className += \" js\";\n\t}\n\tvar rootN = \"https://████/██████████\";\n\tvar whoisURL = \"/████\";\n\tvar eventTitle = \"\";\n\tvar ████; //Whether the person is on the receiving end of chats\n\tvar internalPath = 'search/node/';alert('chron0x');'';\n\u003c/script\u003e\n[...]\n```\nThis pops an alert box, demonstrating XSS.\n\nNote: I am reporting this here, since the footer of `█████████` states `Official United States ████ Website. The █████ ████████.`, and the United States ██████████ underlies the DoD. If this should not belong to the DoD scope I would kindly ask to self close this issue.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Visit `https://██████████/search/node/%27%3Balert%28%27chron0x%27%29%3B%27`\n\nAn alert box with `chron0x` pops.\n\nI am attaching an image demonstrating the XSS.\n\n## Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nSanitize the input for the article parameter, such that certain characters are encoded or not allowed.\n\n## Impact\n\nMedium - Data can be stolen, or Javascript can be executed.","weakness":{"id":61,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":7,"voters":["battle_angel","chron0x_","dastan_9408","khizer47","dilden","hacknova66","waters_ro"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10151781,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
