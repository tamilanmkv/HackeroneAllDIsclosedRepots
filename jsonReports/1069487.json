When “localhost6” is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the attacker uses the “localhost6” domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.\n\nReasoning why localhost6 is not so common and Node.js should not rely on its presence in the hosts file:\n\n* It is not even present in the node:latest Docker image (sha256:aa1930b56896a43dedb227526d5d40f4a6e9157f9d8703f9584650cde510438a)\n* I haven't seen it in Windows 10.\n* Unlike RFC 6761 for localhost, I have found no RFC that mentions localhost6 (see https://www.google.com/search?q=localhost6+site%3Atools.ietf.org ).\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\nPreconditions: Victim has no entry for localhost6 in hosts and attacker controls DNS responses. (It does not matter if the attacker control the DNS server or the network communication between the DNS server and the victim.)\n\n  1. Victim runs node with --inspect option\n  2. Victim visits attacker's webpage\n  3. The attacker's webpage opens http://localhost6:9229\n  4. Victim finds no “localhost6” entry in hosts file, so it asks the DNS server and gets \u003cattacker's-IP\u003e. (Maybe the response will have a short TTL. There are multiple tricks to make DNS rebinding successful in a short time, but I am not going to be exhaustive.)\n  5. Victim loads webpage http://localhost6:9229 from \u003cattacker's-IP\u003e.\n  6. The webpage http://localhost6:9229 tries to load http://localhost6:9229/json from attacker's server. (If the IP address of “localhost6” is still cached, attacker needs to retry. There are techniques that can speed it up, like using RST packet.)\n  7. Due to a short TTL, the DNS server will be soon asked again about an entry for “localhost6”. This time, the DNS server responds “127.0.0.1”.\n  8. The http://localhost6:9229 website (i.e., the one hosted on \u003cattacker's IP\u003e) will retrieve http://localhost6:9229/json from 127.0.0.1, including webSocketDebuggerUrl.\n  9. Now, the attacker knows the webSocketDebuggerUrl and can connect to is using WebSocket. Note that WebSocket is not restricted by same-origin-policy. By doing so, they can gain the privileges of the Node.js instance.\n\nVulnerable code: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/fdf0a84e826d3a9ec0ce6f5a3f5adc967fe99408/src/inspector_socket.cc#L584\n\n## Impact:\n\nAttacker can gain access to the Node.js debugger, which can result in remote code execution.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * Original vulnerability: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-7160\n  * Vulnerable code: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/fdf0a84e826d3a9ec0ce6f5a3f5adc967fe99408/src/inspector_socket.cc#L584\n  * Documentation that mentions the vulnerable behavior: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/\n\n## Impact\n\nAttacker can gain access to the Node.js debugger, which can result in remote code execution.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2021-03-25T14:44:09.635Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-17275078.85686842,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["mr-medi","ali","vivek111","hackforsecurity"],"severity":{"rating":"high","score":7.5,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":666,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10248018,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the report.

This is doable for local network adversary that can intercept all your traffic or for your DNS provider.\n\nOn reproduction: There are multiple approachs:\n\nA. Simulation: This approach does not rely much on environment. It skips DNS server, web browser and /etc/hosts, so it does not actually perform the DNS rebinding, it just simulates its outcome from Node.js perspective: A client from trusted network (i.e., loopback in this case) tries to access a security-sensitive resource, but the Host HTTP header actually corresponds with an attacker's domain (i.e., “localhost6” in this case). It can be easily done with curl oneliner:\n\ncurl 127.0.0.1:9229/json -H \"Host: localhost6\"\n\nAdvantages: Easy to do, does not depend much on environment.\n\nDisadvantages: The simulation does not explain the principle of the attack. It also does not test doability under a specific environment.\n\nB. Basic attack scenario: Just getting http://127.0.0.1:9229/json by an actual DNS rebinding attack. I can dockerize some DNS rebinding script that demonstrates actual attack. Maybe I cannot dockerize DNS spoofing, but if you voluntarily use the malicious DNS server, you can reproduce the attack.\n\nC. Doing complete attack scenario. This requires to perform B first. Then, you can connect to the webSocketDebuggerUrl and debug the Node.js application. With enough understanding of the protocol (or with a WebSocket reverse proxy and manual work), the attacker can obtain debug console and execute some demo command, e.g., child_process.exec(\"xterm\") or child_process.exec(\"calc.exe\"). For doing so, it seems that we need to send something like this:\n{\"id\":\u003csequential id\u003e,\"method\":\"Runtime.evaluate\",\"params\":{\"expression\":\"child_process.exec(\\\"xterm\\\")\",\"objectGroup\":\"console\",\"includeCommandLineAPI\":true,\"silent\":false,\"contextId\":1,\"returnByValue\":false,\"generatePreview\":true,\"userGesture\":true,\"awaitPromise\":false,\"replMode\":true}}\n\nMaybe we will need to do perform some handshake first or create some context, not sure.

There are two requirements:\n\n1. It needs to be permanent.\n2. You need to check the point of view of all browsers rather than Node.js's PoV.\n\nIn real world, there are multiple issues (both theoretical and practical) with ensuring any of those requirement:\n\n* Obviously, you shouldn't ask DNS, as it would break (1) – doing so would make the attack still possible, just a little harder. Maybe you would need to just check the hosts file.\n* Format ambiguities (rather theoretical) could break (2) – when having multiple parsers of hosts file, there can be some edge cases that can lead to Node.js thinking that there is a proper record for localhost6, while some browser would ignore that.\n* Updates (rather theoretical) – a system update can break (1) by removing localhost6 from\n* Sandboxing can break (2). Docker images can have a different /etc/hosts, so it can break. And while Flatpak/Snap look safe, there are potential more sandboxing mechanisms that I haven't explored or that will be created in future.\n* Trusted local subnetwork can break (2). (The trusted subnetwork might be virtual, i.e., inside a single virtual computer, which is a special case of the previous point.) When you allow other (maybe virtual) computers within this network to access the host, they might be also abused for this attack, as they might have a different hosts file.\n\n-----\nIn my opinion, adding further measures that would allow keeping “localhost6” entry in the whitelist is hard (or even impossible) to do it right.
