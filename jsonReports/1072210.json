With this issue Low privileged user's like collaborator users can still access DEV environment even workplace owner unchecked dev access permission from owner account. With this issue collaborator user can unlimited access that dev environment functionality until workplace owner remove collaborator user from manage access area. Actually when workplace owner allow collaborator user to access to dev environment by check to dev then collaborator user get dev access , but after then if owner tries to uncheck dev environment to collaborator user then still collaborator user can use fully access of dev environment. Only if owner remove collaborator user from manage access tab then only access permission is denied. I think this is vulnerability that collaborator user can access dev environment even owner uncheck his access.\n\nStep to reproduce:\n1. visit dashboard.doppler.com\n2. Create 2 different accounts ( 1. owner and 2 collaborator to his workplace / )\n3. now create project and goto manage access tab from workplace owner account.\n4.  then goto manage access area and check allow dev environment to collaborator\n5. Goto dev environment from collaborator and access dev environment\n6. Now again uncheck dev environment to collaborator\n7. now at this time collaborator should to get access denied to access dev environment but collaborator still fully accessing dev without any problem .\n8. But for the fully access denied owner have to delete him from that manage access area other wise collaborator unlimited access that environment.\n\n\nSolution:\n1. If owner unchecks any environment permission then other low privileged user should get access denied to accessing that environment.\n\n## Impact\n\n1. Unauthorized access of functionality.","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic Errors"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":2,"voters":["iamsaugat","b33f7513683daaee5b94e97"],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":58435,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"dashboard.doppler.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10278865,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report.
