The encryption module is advertised as a way to use a potentially untrusted external storage [1].\n\nLet's assume someone uses owncloud with the encryption module and an untrusted storage and expects the data to be safe. A windows software application gets uploaded and shared in this owncloud instance. As an example we can use the putty.exe file [2].\n\nMost Windows EXE files have a very unique structure. By Xor-ing data one can manipulate that. CFB mode allows bitwise manipulations, but these will cause the next block to contain garbage data.\n\nThe PoC attack I developed will:\na) First flip a single bit in the third block of the file. This will cause the fourth block to contain garbage and thus the file will no longer be a valid PE file. Thereby Windows will execute the DOS part of that executable.\nb) EXE files contain usually a DOS stub that is almost always the same. We can now Xor our own code over that DOS part and thus backdoor the Executable.\n\nThis gives one 16 bytes of code execution. This is quite limited, but it can be extended by doing more manipulations on the file and jumping to other manipulated blocks. I haven't done that, but it's definitely doable. My PoC will create an EXE file that prints out the chars \"PWN\".\n\nTo mount the attack:\n* Unpack the attched tarball\n* run \"make\" in the pwncloud dir\n* run \"pwncloud [file]\" with [file] being an exe file in an encrypted owncloud storage\nThe attach script itself is written in bash, it requires a small C tool to xor files and a small piece of assembly code that is compiled with nasm.\n\nThis attack is made even easier by the fact that the filename is not hidden from the attacker. He can see which files are EXE files and backdoor them all. A variant of this attack could be executed if there are files in the storage with other file formats and content known to the attacker (e.g. a zip file or tarball from a popular application).\n\nThe bottom line is: Using encryption without any authentication or signatures is dangerous. It should not be used in any circumstances. In its current form the owncloud encryption module should not be used and not be trusted.\n\n\n[1] https://owncloud.org/blog/how-owncloud-uses-encryption-to-protect-your-data/\n[2] http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html\n","bounty_amount":"350.0","formatted_bounty":"$350","weakness":{"id":32,"name":"Cryptographic Issues - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":67754,"file_name":"pwncloud.tar.xz","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/067/754/4cdfeeaac1926f5d162db2b13e18422fa0286acb/pwncloud.tar.xz?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22pwncloud.tar.xz%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27pwncloud.tar.xz\u0026response-content-type=application%2Fx-xz\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ77TMTAFX%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T132307Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHQaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCICucm0jzvD3QISJcdxs15I345d%2Bix4EPkAt2aiYpOpdLAiEA4nsHwmQauYXeRj2fqr%2FRPQvyF0GdJ2cF06PXfZnVZHUqgwQI7f%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDCcz%2F%2BsEiqWc0DUpwirXA2k6GtLMgoAsl9NCZ55wDpMp4kgwISr3ljm%2B8a7xcwiicQhhIArUvgh3L3TswkYJ7UwHTth8qcnjo%2B0r0ur2DG7VqYFOsB64ZJK%2B50np3hTJAOjcnuao2VJ3aNvW7aI3KOGWa9X70WTRmIF9l7hp%2FuS34OIwkvWCOwRjM5OjQVXbjQFM7laXpxh%2FIMPjqWNU12tk0AE8sHkU5ZHji%2FHsjdATutxCfSVF2F9AqVHQb1cooNHKpvHPZ7cWy1PI1ti9jcQSmw2nWXaHgo03WL%2FbvWsJE5sINQQTBsbPtj6HkRi2DYtMUj%2FCwp1gWWtqmj%2BE9KFI3Up9F2XHSiQl%2F%2FzvBzvGobU%2BJanerONSlBFtZCzzuGYQKKlCaEiQWQaAep2w06bdqL74pk%2F%2F7Z%2FblDV2PQiXH9DA8gZWJ35R3Kx1O181tMdE6GlimskssWXw3T7FKDxBjdE5vIrvXULIPEGMcgt9OkzBWdkBye6JbTUwFlu91n75BywzEPJrwt7Axf59f%2B6xTHJQWcV5WQInKY66J1ACrRORDwto1eqasXN39woy8OtaG3C9ZjySQvFJBGILbK0TxCvZgofoxTM%2BVXaA%2BUgCUR5fD0zOrI%2FNOjIZ9FF4dCOawt3PTDCV0ZCLBjqlAZ9nw3V49gsDLsG7%2Bwjmt2rtA8gTy2t9ICg%2FUFq98yLSqBNvcZCLsRE1tJ%2FV5%2Brm7vi2mQ%2B%2F2k8CjaKIz6e%2BFbIVE0ufGQllyLCGU9w2IZ5XgnrOKkujdYvP046TFXIFjhpPmRttoV7G0BUQ4Yi%2FArYY6hOa%2FLO2yvUEgyWWfJzu8mIECYte5aLcfXi6bl%2BN6EUD9LibMaoGMQJod0PL6A98fU3YOQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=45c22af9691f877d8fc1f972ff489e2cd7890494c9d5b3da00b5907f1f077ab9","file_size":1520,"type":"application/x-xz"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-04-07T16:39:48.568Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-173911399.10399306,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["lukasreschke","bapt","armansameer","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":740502,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us.

The not yet merged and not fully completed changeset can be seen at https://github.com/owncloud/core/tree/use-hmac-over-encryption at the moment. We've also done some other small changes to the encryption code such as actually using a 16 byte IV instead of stretching a 14 byte IV. â€“ If you have some spare minutes left we'd appreciate if you could take a look at this. There are some changes on-going such as using a different key for the HMAC derived using HKDF which are not yet in the repository though.\n\nSwitching to a different cipher allows us to enforce the HMAC on files encrypted with AES-256-CTR (or AES-128-CTR). The small caveat of this solution is that only new or modified files will be encrypted using the new encryption logic. The old ones will not be touched. While this is not a perfect solution we're considering this trade-off acceptable considering that a bug in a migration routine would likely lead to a massive data loss, and while we encourage backups the truth is that many people don't have proper ones.\n\nFurthermore we're working on a clarifying the threat model in our documentation further as well as ensure secure defaults in combination with external storage, for example the file scanner needs to be configured to not run on external storages when encryption is enabled as otherwise it would scan unencrypted files and add them to the data store. While some user may consider this a wanted behaviour it is probably not for most and thus we're going to adjust the default on this one.\n\nConsidering the risk  that any change to a key component brings we are at the moment not considering a backport and will make sure to update the documentation on this one as well soon. The documentation for older releases will state clearly that there is no integrity protection provided.\n\nLet me use this opportunity again for thanking you to bring up this problem to us and this high quality submission of yours.

I think this is irresponsible and dangerous. Crypto is hard. Designing a crypto storage concept is not something you just come up with because you learned some crypto basics. I'd argue designing crypto storage may be even harder than crypto transport protocols, because there's much less research on it. (For an overview of the potential pitfalls I recommend this talk by Adam Langley [1].)\n\nIn conclusion: I think if a crypto protocol doesn't have the involvement of an expert (and by \"expert\" I mean someone whose name I have read multiple times in the past on crypto papers or relevant bug reports) you can be almost certain that it will not be secure.\n\nI haven't seen any obvious flaws in your new design on a first look (though I wonder why you chose to bake your own CTR+HMAC solution instead of using an AEAD cipher). But I think if you want to handle this issue responsible you basically have two options: Either ditch the crypto functionality or redesign it in cooperation with a crypto implementation expert. Maybe your crypto will be strong enough to prevent me from finding a flaw in it, but that doesn't mean it's secure.\n\nRegarding your request for disclosure: I will of course wait for a reasonable timeframe. Once you have solved the issue with whatever measurements I plan to publish a blog post (and maybe publications on other platforms) and it will likely include the criticism I have outlined here.\n\n[1] https://news.yahoo.com/video/yahoo-trust-unconference-tls-adam-223046696.html","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-01-06T21:46:40.646Z","updated_at":"2016-01-06T21:46:40.646Z","actor":{"username":"hanno","cleared":false,"url":"/hanno","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/020/918/74da560ef66bf8cc239e219843444b441a7dfac6_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"owncloud","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":746012,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"We don't disagree with you on this.

Having looked at the scheme now I must revise my earlier judgement. This scheme is still very problematic and it's quite easy to see.\nWhat you're doing now is you're using counter mode on fixed size blocks of a file. This means you have authenticity over blocks, but not on the order of the blocks.\nWhat an attacker can trivially do is shuffle around the encrypted blocks. This is pretty simple: The blocks are aligned to 8192 bytes, prepended by another block of 8192 bytes that contains the header.\nExample:\nsplit -b 8192 [encrypted_file]\ncat xaa xac xab \u003e encrypted_file\n\nThese commands would move the second block of the file to the beginning, append the first block and discard the rest of the file. You end up with a valid file that owncloud will decrypt and the attacker has some limited amount of control over the output. While it is more difficult to find a practically exploitable scenario than in the first example, this still doesn't meet a reasonable definition of cryptographic security (in more formal words, it is not IND-CCA2 secure).\n\nI rest my case that designing an ad-hoc encryption scheme without proper review is dangerous and will almost certainly lead to more vulnerabilities.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-01-09T16:00:59.408Z","updated_at":"2016-01-09T16:00:59.408Z","actor":{"username":"hanno","cleared":false,"url":"/hanno","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/020/918/74da560ef66bf8cc239e219843444b441a7dfac6_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"owncloud","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":783176,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Apologize for the late follow-up on this from our side. We have been internally working on some changes for the issue you pointed out and didn't want to provide an update until we have a proposed solution to these. Nice catch and thanks a lot for spending your time on helping us improving this situation.\n\nThe current approach we're targeting for our master branch is the following:\n\n1. We keep the version number in another file next to the keys. The version number is also included in the HMAC calculation. This change can be seen at [core/bfb39de9](https://github.com/owncloud/core/commit/bfb39de9e5f862fb4b9fe83d1ad12b6172bd16b1).\n2. Each encrypted chunk has an incrementing number that is also included in the HMAC calculation. We keep track of the amount of chunks so that it should not be possible to remove ending chunks of the file.  This change can be seen at [core/01a9bab6](https://github.com/owncloud/core/commit/01a9bab6f6adb791a0d800cd55d029138ee3118c).\n\nThose commits may change if the Pull Request gets rebased so the newest version can be found in the [use-hmac-over-encryption branch on GitHub](https://github.com/owncloud/core/commits/use-hmac-over-encryption). As discussed in-person at FOSDEM we're aiming to include this with ownCloud 9.0 which is scheduled to be released around 2016-03-08, the release date might shift a bit depending on QA testing but we'll keep you updated. We'd be happy to do a coordinated disclose once we have released 9.0. (we'll also make this whole issue public at this point)\n\nOn a related note with regard to the encryption of file names and the folder structure which you have brought up at FOSDEM as well,  [we are aiming to to address this with ownCloud 9.1](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/22105). Please note that this is a documented behaviour, as a first step for 9.0 we'll already make this and some more potential caveats more prominent within the ownCloud interface when enabling the encryption app.\n\nWe might adjust these approaches such as for example moving those two files into one, but you should get the overall picture.\n\nThanks a lot again for reporting this issue back to us and your spent efforts. We would very much appreciate if you could take a glimpse at the proposed patches by us and let us know if you see any problem with it.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-02-03T16:41:48.942Z","updated_at":"2016-02-03T16:46:10.812Z","actor":{"username":"lukasreschke","cleared":false,"url":"/lukasreschke","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/037/891/e7fea4d5383dc07d1fe767b02f3bda2bc7639c63_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"owncloud","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":793985,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"We have today published beta1 of ownCloud 9.0.0 which will include these changes: http://download.owncloud.org/community/testing/owncloud-9.0beta1.tar.bz2\n\nWe are aiming for the announced 9.0.0 release date of 8 March.

This plugin can be enabled to encrypt the file contents with a per-user key.\n\nDue to the missing Authenticated Encryption a malicious storage administrator could tamper with the encrypted ciphertext. In case of binary files such as EXE files this may for example allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the encrypted files.\n\nAs an hardening measure to ownCloud 9.0 we have done the first step to mitigate this attack vector: We've introduced authenticated encryption. Due to this in a properly configured ownCloud server a storage administrator can't modify files anymore, if a file gets tampered it won't be downloadable anymore.\n\nWe're aware that the ownCloud Encryption module is not yet perfect and are constantly working on improving it. As a next step we're aiming at [encrypting file names](https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/22105).\nWe were technically aware of this vulnerability and the report of @hanno has increased it's severity given his proof of concept for modifying binary files. This was also the reason why we didn't mention encryption as a measure to ensure integrity, in older ownCloud it simply guaranteed that a storage admin could not access the file content.\n\nWe recommend administrators using the ownCloud Encryption module to read [our documentation](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/9.0/admin_manual/configuration_files/encryption_configuration.html) with more information about the ownCloud encryption.\n\n------\n\nA [blog post by Hanno BÃ¶ck](https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/880-Pwncloud-bad-crypto-in-the-Owncloud-encryption-module.html) covering this issue is also available.
