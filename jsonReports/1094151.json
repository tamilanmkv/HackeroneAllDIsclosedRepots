In this case I found a Rockset API key, This API key is not in the current code, but it is visible in an old commit.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nYou can find the leak in this link : https://github.com/rockset/recipes/pull/19/files\n\n```\n        /* Getting the distance covered by each vehicle using the latest and oldest locations */\n        distance_for_vehicles AS (\n        SELECT\n            ST_DISTANCE(\n@@ -128,7 +147,7 @@\n    'q4': query4 \n}\n\napi_key = \"skZMJRZSXLZZj5HAdBjNxUfZbarWV5dLqfVO6U623zW5KROzfY0vNRa22ToZfRRe\"\n```\n\nThen I visited the documentation of Rockset ( https://docs.rockset.com/rest-api/ ) and I found this way to check if the API key is revoke or not\n```\ncurl --request GET \\\n    --url https://api.rs2.usw2.rockset.com/v1/orgs/self/users/self/apikeys \\\n    -H 'Authorization: ApiKey skZMJRZSXLZZj5HAdBjNxUfZbarWV5dLqfVO6U623zW5KROzfY0vNRa22ToZfRRe'\n```\nand I got this answer:\n```\n{\"data\":[{\"created_at\":\"2019-10-22T06:08:37Z\",\"name\":\"K1\",\"key\":\"skZMJRZSXLZZj5HAdBjNxUfZbarWV5dLqfVO6U623zW5KROzfY0vNRa22ToZfRRe\",\"last_access_time\":null,\"created_by\":null}]}\n```\nSo I could verify that it was not revoked\n\n## Impact\n\nI just checked that the key was not revoked. I didn't try anything with the token  to be prudent, and I don't know the real impact of this, But I think it is a good idea to share this with you, to avoid any risk that may grow.\n\nRegards!","weakness":{"id":33,"name":"Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":17,"voters":["najeh_halawani","th4nu_0x0","ali","demonia","salahhasoneh","since2003","khizer47","sa1tama0","sdushantha","mr_x_strange","and 7 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":49978,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"api.*.rockset.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10573038,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @afsec,\n\nThank you for your submission.
