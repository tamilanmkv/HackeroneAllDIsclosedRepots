Fix out for review:\n\nhttps://secure.phabricator.com/D14993\n\nBecause `$key` is *usually* the last object examined (since it was the last index in the earlier loop), this bug almost always just causes us to just do more work than we need to (at least, in theory) rather than causing policy violations. However, by mixing capability groups in the input list, I can force `$key` to be examined sooner (as part of an earlier capability group) and sneak later objects through the filter.\n\nI believe this has no security impact in the application today: as far as I know, we do not perform any checks which mix capability tests, and I believe we don't even perform any meaningful checks on more than one object with a single policy extension today. This case (checking just one object) isn't impacted since `$key` and `$extended_key` will always be the same.\n\nThat said, I agree that it is very likely that future changes (like subprojects) would have hit this in a way that created a real security issue. It's possible that I would have caught it before then, but I think I'm giving myself too much credit to suggest that it was anything short of *nearly inevitable* that this would eventually become an issue with material impact.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-01-11T13:02:55.648Z","updated_at":"2016-01-11T13:02:55.648Z","actor":{"username":"epriestley","cleared":false,"url":"/epriestley","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/043/3ebca5250ea5abd54b49ccc9d69c636af4585b2e_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"phabricator","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":752776,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your attention.
