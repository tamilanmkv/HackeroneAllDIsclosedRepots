Hope Y'all good and fine.\n\n## Summary:\nI would like to report another vulnerability very Similar to my other report in #975991\n\n\nDue to lack of secure design, I was able to find the origin IPs behind Cloludflare WAF.\n\nThe IPs I found belong to :\n\n3d.cs.money\n\n## Description:\n\nI was able to find and access the Origin IPs behind the WAF due to lack of access control,\nI could also port scan the IP \n\nThe IP found :\n51.83.253.82\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nsimply visit:\n\nhttps://51.83.253.82/\n\n## Impact\n\nAs reported in many other submissions, Cloudflare bypasses can have a significant impact, as any adversary is now able to communicate with the origin server directly, enabling them to perform unfiltered attacks (such as denial-of-service), and data retrieval.\n\nThis attack vector can be extremely bad because with the IP found out an attacker could attack the servers by DDoS or other attacks without being stopped by CloudFlare.]\n\nThanks!","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design

This issue is very similar to a report I reported before and I explained why it's not safe to expose the staging server,  The Report #975991\n\n\n\u003ewell as this is the staging environment\nit is a clone of the productive website. meaning that it contain the same source code of the productive one\n\n\u003eas so, whatever vulnerability found in the staging environment it will definietly applies to the productive site,\n\n\u003ethe productive site is protected behind the Cloudflare WAF and the staging site is not protected.\n\n\u003eso It would be very easy for the attacker to hack on the unprotected site and whatever vulnerability found in that site would affect the productive one.\n\n\u003ethe attacker can test for all kind of different vulnerability that the waf would make it a bit difficult to test for e.g XSS, SQL injection, XXE and Injection attacks ...etc, very easily and when he find a successful vulnerability all he do is to craft the payload to bypass the WAF on the productive site.\n\n\u003eHope that make it very clear how it make attackers' life very easy if the staging environment isn't protected behind a WAF as the productive site does.\n\n\nThanks!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-02-21T17:41:37.934Z","updated_at":"2021-02-21T17:41:37.934Z","actor":{"username":"sawmj","cleared":false,"url":"/sawmj","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/1MbgBQr1umRfiZeFhxsUS8gs/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"cs_money","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10734764,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Also
