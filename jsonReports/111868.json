This is my first report on HackerOne and I had no idea what I was doing. While I'm not killing it now, still continue to submit reports which get closed as Informative, often go through a dry spell of finding no vulnerabilities, I'd like to think since this submission, I'm improving and have provided value to HackerOne, Shopify, Twitter, MoneyBird, DrChrono, Veris and other private programs.\n\nYou can probably guess reading my submission, I was clueless to the fact that HackerOne made POST calls to auto save submissions. I also have the OWASP XSS link open in my screenshot and am testing trying to make HackerOne send unintended emails. I'm also not sure why I searched \"get browser to execute JS\". Pretty indicative of my skill level at the time.\n\nI hope this helps others realize we all have to start somewhere. I, no doubt, have contributed to bug bounty noise. Ben Sadeghipour, Patrik Fehrenbach, Philippe Harewood and Adam Bacchus are great examples of an alternative means to reducing noise - each took the time from their schedules to sit down and teach me, and other new hackers who watch the interviews, how to improve. Additionally, all the hackers who disclose reports or publish detailed write ups should also be acknowledged as helping build the collective hacker community but the list would be too long to include here.","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false,"attachments":[],"user":{"id":46435,"username":"yaworsk","name":"Pete","bio":"@yaworsk","cleared":true,"website":"http://leanpub.com/web-hacking-101","location":"canada","created_at":"2015-12-15T13:46:06.257Z","url":"https://hackerone.com/yaworsk","anc_triager":false,"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false,"user_type":"hacker","profile_picture_urls":{"small":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/046/435/8321e52445321287eea5b5b3f4c9f6ea69e92bb5_original.jpg/43e4513b9104ea0d68c9c096cea374ba8440dde3e027af5465c8771e8839a67c","medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/046/435/8321e52445321287eea5b5b3f4c9f6ea69e92bb5_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c","xtralarge":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/046/435/8321e52445321287eea5b5b3f4c9f6ea69e92bb5_original.jpg/c11036e2d3f8b05af4b5da5984ccdec6f786b763c8abceb4e68042e10dcdae85"}}}]}
