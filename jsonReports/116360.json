This attack, called POODLE, is similar to the BEAST attack and also allows a network attacker to extract the plaintext of targeted parts of an SSL connection, usually cookie data. Unlike the BEAST attack, it doesn't require such extensive control of the format of the plaintext and thus is more practical. \n\nThe impact of this vulnerability\nAn attacker may be able to exploit this problem to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and decrypt communications between the affected service and clients. \n\nHow to fix this vulnerability\nIt's recommended to disable SSLv3 and replace it with TLSv1.0 as soon as compatibility with legacy clients is no longer required. (The only browser that does not support TLSv1.0 is Internet Explorer 6). \n\nTo disable SSLv2 and SSLv3: \nFor Nginx:\nssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; \n\nScreenshots attached for the reference.","bounty_amount":"1.0","formatted_bounty":"$1","weakness":{"id":32,"name":"Cryptographic Issues - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":73443,"file_name":"5.jpg","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/073/443/b0090b8c18ec79dfaaf50e8a4cd368fca53c0483/5.jpg?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%225.jpg%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%275.jpg\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ4NIHB2M2%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T132848Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIE3FUcgRK7FM%2F7U9PAkh6%2BI7wZViD1MP1Y8qZWLRN1eUAiAgc4SQu0yGJV%2BOQRn82JsTD2%2Bd2fHZQycxL60pz%2B7CjyqDBAjt%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMkR9JAvrXeOfq9Rc6KtcDp5bGOpV6FTgydp%2FZOb6Bh6HFPtwnCVZfa015OiSuBfCxPwur%2F7aSPKTNE0sy0w9C45qL0zZ1nOQQos0M24uDH67J2wRZXM50ImEA29W1ENYnCggW3Oj1ThbKF4WgRsg%2F9mjcm%2BZmkVxvLoYJ9V%2BPAToGVUPNdCuARshEYKICR0Xo5x6JoDNaCt8Ld9eGqOBMXV3rned7uAPh8EmsbYJGE3kgeYkoAT36Qaqe4UgPgyO9VFwa9aDWRX%2B50CKWSjbjZzr%2BF%2B9jH4MB%2FxFZ4EWRHEor6ZAw08vWfwqAZLqqZdMNm9vuS82Y9DrOKW2mwiXSVAN3ddQvsOMXsKnTXkUhnfuaQmZvTtYFFm%2BIF8eMq92q4rbYHzak7PfNtWyYQ5raA9JIgznaWFJzJX%2BJlzu%2Bu3r2q3jjPLUM80AxozLcRqWVvYBpiIJlFx45cKPkX%2F2%2BeKoncWc%2B6ePWFPme30ZUDKqp6naa4cEDN31MhQC6Orokr1YD%2FJvOnl4SUarbB1%2BVgfPNBbXbzGIn%2BQ51fempHBLdSWygAxQb8EgPDJYVXZxvBJySlPreu1xMH98Dq97W1%2FcRuSdU1ytWMJPT5MEKol3iFlX9S3vBhB4zpCiL0Qjhs8rBVdayMKLXkIsGOqYB2%2BJTBbMxNO8iefRZNNANeiPRoGrUFs7jVSy6MeL55bB1oEjsBrS1ldm2HFxpIsKxeGY%2Fw5R4r6d07DNpzBAlMx0mvj%2FrMVfwHZDUaLkkIW7L5kfZJyauAUQfU1Yr9%2Flzl1bTl9jiK08pDtPhZS7%2FjLscylmOg0jy%2BlazgeqN9hRW54AGkI6XkZty9qqJMe%2BYbSVGEfkYqEbJxp7dv5pFW%2Ftu9oswsQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=b51157a96c7a15dcf8a4aef0a3e70dccb070adb22e5ee9719eb48c3c86ffbfe1","file_size":357589,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-03-16T16:55:34.961Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-175811593.10594893,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":3,"voters":["cuso4","khizer47","dyabla"],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":798595,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"It appears that upgrading nginx over on #116352 may have fixed this:\n\n```\n$ nmap -sV -Pn --version-light --script ssl-poodle -p 443 198.199.102.190\n\nStarting Nmap 7.01 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2016-02-15 11:39 EST\nNmap scan report for grtp.co (198.199.102.190)\nHost is up (0.095s latency).\nPORT    STATE SERVICE  VERSION\n443/tcp open  ssl/http nginx 1.8.1\n\nService detection performed.
