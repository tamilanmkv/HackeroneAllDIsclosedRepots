But I never the less thing it should be mitigated. Or at least disclosed.\n\nPremissie:\n1. user1 on serverA has a federated share established with user2 on serverB\n2. the database (not the full system) of serverB is compromised\n\nNow since federated shares are not created with a password which is stored encrypted in the database this means that an attacker to serverB obtains access to data on serverA directly.\n\nNow I am aware that if serverB is fully compromised the password could also be decrypted using the server secret\n\n## Impact\n\nUsing federated sharing exposes the servers to a much larger attack service currently. Since an attacker on a different system can obtain access to data on your system as well. In some cases easier than to the target system.\n\nI'd recommend to make sure that there is a password set that is stored encrypted. And that there is a way for admins to obtain a list of federated servers they need to notify in case they had a breach of their own system.","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":2,"voters":["3x3s","ekgaribadmi"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":5.9,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"high","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":13,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"nextcloud/server","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":11429867,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us!\n\nOur security team will take a look at this issue as soon as possible.
