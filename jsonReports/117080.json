This should've marked as 'Duplicate' and not 'Resolved'. We apologize for the miscommunication and confusion here.\n\nThat being said, after reading the 4 links you sent and comparing to #125181 - we can confirm this report was the same WPML vulnerability (CVE-2015-2791). However, the key is that this report didn't provide enough actionable information for us to confirm the existence of SQLi - #125181 provided a PoC demonstrating the SQLi.\n\nOn our end, it appeared our authentication middleware was mitigating any exploit. We mentioned that in this report and you never updated us with more details or a PoC. See this comment from @mandatoryuber on Feb 17:\n\u003e After looking into this it appears that the SQL injection is not possible due to our OneLogin wall halting access to that functionality (if you are able to exploit it, please let us know).\n\nHad you provided more actionable information, this report would've been eligible for bounty. It's the responsibility of the researcher to provide enough information for us to be able to make a determination - this report did not do that.\n\nOur Program Guidelines were updated, unrelated to this issue, to address this exact situation:\n\u003e If we receive several reports for the same issue, we offer the bounty to the earliest report for which we had enough actionable information to identify the issue. We don't want to encourage people spamming us with vague issues in an attempt to be first.\n\nHope this clarifies things.
