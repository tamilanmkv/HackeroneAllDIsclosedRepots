Because of this when a report is closed as 'Informative', you have one more data point with a value of 0 (the reputation granted for 'Informative' bugs), so if your reputation is above 0 your Signal will decrease a little, whereas if your Signal is less than zero it'll increase instead. Does that make sense?\n\nAs for publicly disclosing, seems fine to me. Even though this isn't a security concern it's definitely an interesting little quirk of how our reputation scores are calculated!\n\nThanks!\n\nEvan","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-04-21T22:43:46.599Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T22:43:46.599Z","actor":{"username":"ebrynne","cleared":false,"url":"/ebrynne","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/191/f333df32e9b61845f5c823b77d968fa6d246d336_original./fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":921541,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-04-21T22:43:46.677Z","updated_at":"2016-04-21T22:43:46.677Z","actor":{"username":"ebrynne","cleared":false,"url":"/ebrynne","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/191/f333df32e9b61845f5c823b77d968fa6d246d336_original./fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
