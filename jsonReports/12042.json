The issue you identified is with API endpoints that are used by non-authorized users (yet), for example, the `Authenticate` endpoint. So, when using this endpoint, we don't have a user id yet, he's not authenticated. But, we should enforce rate limits nonetheless. \n\nSo, since we already have rate limits for authenticated users, the suggestion is to limit on IP basis any open API endpoint (such as Authenticate) and limit it to 60 requests per hours. Which should prevent any real malicious threat.\n\nAlso, it might be wise to add a mechanism to allow only X number of authentication fails before being blacklisted. We already have a blacklisting protocol in place, so adding IPs to it (for a ban period) shouldn't be that difficult.\n\nI hope it all makes sense,\nItay","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-05-15T17:56:45.109Z","updated_at":"2014-05-15T17:56:45.109Z","actor":{"username":"itayw","cleared":false,"url":"/itayw","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"joola-io","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":51787,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I think this will mitigate the risk.
