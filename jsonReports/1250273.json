A local or physical attacker can identify the exact moment a user connected to a new v2 onion site, easily triangulating the user via a complete log of connection timestamps in the log file, or verbosely in the terminal window. This timestamp is generated every single time a client connects to a v2 onion address and could therefore be easily compared with a server connection log, a compromised Tor end point, or other related Tor attack, affecting the confidentiality \u0026 integrity of a user's Tor session when using --log or --verbose.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nDownload Tor latest\nUse either:\n`./start-tor-browser.desktop --log ./file.log`\n`./start-tor-browser.desktop --verbose`\n\nVisit http://wikitoronionlinks.com/\n\nClick on an assortment of .onion v2 URLs.\n\nInspect the output.\n\nNotably, the warning occurs when the client connects, rather than clicking a link, making it even easier to pair up with server connection times.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n```\n[user@hostname tor-browser_en-US]$ ./start-tor-browser.desktop --verbose\nLaunching './Browser/start-tor-browser --detach --verbose'...\nFontconfig warning: \"/tmp/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/fontconfig/fonts.conf\", line 37: Use of ambiguous path in \u003cdir\u003e element. please add prefix=\"cwd\" if current behavior is desired.\nFontconfig warning: \"/tmp/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/fontconfig/fonts.conf\", line 85: unknown element \"blank\"\nJul 02 20:06:58.983 [notice] Tor 0.4.5.9 (git-d0ed04d50e80fe1c) running on Linux with Libevent 2.1.11-stable, OpenSSL 1.1.1k, Zlib 1.2.11, Liblzma N/A, Libzstd N/A and Glibc 2.33 as libc.\nJul 02 20:06:58.983 [notice] Tor can't help you if you use it wrong!

Yes, I am suggesting less granularity in the logs given the absolute accuracy of the data. The warning is only a month old.\n\nOne major concern is that the debug/verbose timestamps occurs at the **actual time of successful connection to the service**, as opposed to **when the client/browser enters the URL into the address bar, or attempts to connect to a v2 address**. The video shows this quite clearly, in that, I open a bunch of tabs in the background, and the log delays the warning until the full connection is made.\n\nSince the browser could easily detect a v2 vs v3 onion address simply by the length of the address, I don't believe there's a reason for the client to log the absolute connection time, given the length of the URL is a clear indicator of the new protocol.\n\nAlthough that itself may have it's own issues in terms of having the exact timestamp of the beginning of the connection attempt, plus the actual connection time.\n\nE.g.\n`You've just connected to a v2 onion address.`\n\n`You've just entered a v2 onion address.`\n\nThere's already a large banner warning on the Tor launch page, so I would argue there's no real reason to log exact v2 address timestamps in the current form, or as verbose as they are.\n\nAlternatively, maybe warn users just once in the console per browser session, rather than each and every single time the client successfully connects to a v2 onion service?\n\nIn essence, the logging as-is, is recording unnecessary metadata for every v2 onion address visited, when using verbose or log to file.\n\nI did consider raising this as an issue in the Git, however, I do believe there are risks involved while using those methods.\n\nPlease do let me know what you think, and thanks again for getting back so quickly on this!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-07-02T21:50:34.823Z","updated_at":"2021-07-02T21:50:34.823Z","actor":{"username":"sickcodes","cleared":false,"url":"/sickcodes","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/yhqjS3Lp1zFH9fw8UdN1WUFh/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"torproject","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":12381224,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Thanks a lot for this report @sickcodes .
