When loading ```https://developer.uber.com/docs/test'test```, the following HTML is rendered: \n\n``` html\n\u003ca href=\"/docs/test\" test'=\"\" require-login=\"\"\u003elogging in\u003c/a\u003e\n```\n\nNote that the injected ```'``` is rendered in the HTML as a closing ```\"``` that closes the href= section. Sadly, I have been unable to find any way of exploiting this because when I inject an ```=``` (in order to inject ```onmouseover=alert(0)```), it is rendered as ```%3d``` which prevents me from obtaining javascript execution. Injecting a ```\u003e``` to close the tag also does not work. \n\nSo I'll admit that this is not a high priority vulnerability, but I still believe that it should be fixed since it allows for the user to inject limited content into a ```\u003ca href```. \n\nThanks,\nDavid Dworken","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-05-01T22:08:42.091Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-171818767.18735942,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":865437,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hey David, thanks for the report!\n\nYour assessment seems correct here.
