The mechanisms of: \"include\", \"mx\", \"a\", \"ptr\", and \"exists\"  count against the limit of 10 lookups. The \"all, \"ip4\", and \"ip6\" mechanisms do not count against the limit of 10 since they do not require a DNS Lookup.\n\nSPF implementations should be restrict the number of DNS Lookups to 10 per check in order to explicitly limit how much data will be accepted to:\n\nPrevent excessive bandwidth usage or memory usage\nPrevent DoS attacks\nIf you use the \"include\" in your SPF record, it will have referenced SPF records evaluated with your SPF record and as a direct result the DNS Lookup count is dependent upon third parties. If you are close to reaching your limit of 10 DNS Lookups and someone in your \"include\" adds additional DNS record to their own SPF record, you could easily go over your limit of 10.\n\nHow can you fix this?\nPrune unnecessary :include files from the SPF record.\nUse different domains for mail from different places so you don’t need one SPF record to rule them all.\nDon’t publish SPF records, rely on DKIM for authentication.
