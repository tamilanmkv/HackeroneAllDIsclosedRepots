I hear what you're saying. However, I believe that it's only the case because you know that the user ID belonged to ██████ to begin with. Not mentioning that the URLs are sensitive feels a bit implied, so I'm not super confident yet that we're considering that to be a security vulnerability, but I'll discuss it with a few others. Until then though, ████████ is very thankful about you reporting the security vulnerability and wanted to send you some swag. They gave me the following link: ████████. No worries, I don't have your email address, so I won't be able to see your address (haha). One thing the asked me to pass along: a user is only required to enter their email address again after 10 minutes have passed, so keep that in mind when retesting the vulnerability and checking out the new flow. Let me know if you have any feedback for them that you want me to pass along.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-07-13T00:01:04.997Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T19:56:50.777Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":12479780,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello, \n\u003e\u003e I don't have your email address, so I won't be able to see your address (haha).\n\nhaha you are 1337, most probably my password is in your wordlist xD :P\n\nI understand that it might be implied and I am unable to find any other link leaked from a H1 researcher, other than the one i mentioned earlier,\nbut if you use a google dork ie \"site:███████\" in the results you will see different links getting indexed as they were leaked somewhere, for example I also managed to find a live one \n██████ \n(the swag hasn't shipped yet so I could have changed the delivery address I guess if the email wasn't required. )\nthats why I think that H1 mentioning that link is supposed to be a secret will be better. \n\nAlso for the program I want to say Thanks for the swag :) , The fix looks good.\n**For the google Indexing issue they should use noindex metatag rather than adding a robots.txt file\nbeacuse this will work more efficiently for this particular scenario ie even if the links get leaked they won't get indexed.**\nThis will make the dork ineffective .\nAdditional Reference :https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/block-indexing\n\n\nThanks ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-07-13T19:49:28.738Z","updated_at":"2021-08-09T19:52:14.912Z","actor":{"username":"iamr0000t","cleared":true,"url":"/iamr0000t","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/QhrziThBSupEvsTUJ5hener4/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":12480296,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @iamr0000t - thanks for pointing that out!
