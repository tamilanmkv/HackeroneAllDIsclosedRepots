This can be used to see if a given e-mail has a NewRelic account, and in turn can be used to enumerate all accounts on NewRelic.\n\nWith an e-mail that already exists, the time to return a response takes more than ~800ms (though this number varies). If the e-mail does not already exist, the time to return a response takes much less (around ~400ms).\n\nIt may be a bit fuzzy at times, but through repeated trials it is easy to check if an e-mail is in use, and so a list of users using NewRelic can be generated. This can be dangerous.\n\nA recommended fix against this is to take the same time to verify the log-in credentials for both real users and non-existent users.","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-09-25T23:24:48.123Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-159113468.8366226,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["glc","laps-forever","dyabla","simonhajjar"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":883492,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks for your report â€“ this is a great find!
