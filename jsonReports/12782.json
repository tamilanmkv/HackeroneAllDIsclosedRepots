Besides this behaviour being potentially annoying, it doesn't have any security implications. These kind of best practices are somewhere on our roadmap, but we don't consider them urgent. We have several monitoring tools in place that notify us when people actively abuse such functionality. Closing the issue as not applicable because I don't see any harm in the concern you raised here. Also keep in mind that you can also do this by simply sending a thousand emails to a certain email address.\n\nSide note: noticed you submitted a series of best practices to us lately.. This is fine by me, but please note that we're most interested in bugs that actually have (in)direct security implications (such as XSS, CSRF, RCE, SQLI or authentication/authorization bypasses - to name a few). I'm sure you know a lot about security, but try to focus more on bugs that are exploitable (also for the cash bonuses we reward for real security bugs - we love to pay for awesome finds!).
