Generally, clickjacking is used to get a user to click on something in the frame that they didn't intend to click on, (and indeed usually cannot see), but without seeing the Uber login, how would an attacker get their victim to enter their credentials?  And if the attacker DID make this form visible to a user, it would still be clear to the user they weren't on uber.com from the URL bar.  And in any case, the attacker could simply make a copy of this form and place it on their site - no reason to clickjack at all.  Can you clarify the attack you have in mind?
