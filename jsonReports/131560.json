CrashPlan allows users to backup to a friends computer by entering a 6 digit alphanumeric code. This means there are 2,176,782,336 total CrashPlan friend codes. While this is a high number, it is completely possible to brute force this as CrashPlan does not have any rate limiting on their end point to check the validity of a code. \n\nBy iterating through all the friend codes I would be able to find the friend code for the CrashPlan instance running on ```backup.uber.com``` thereby allowing me to upload my data to the server hosting ```backup.uber.com```. \n\nI wasn't quite sure what to categorize this as so I put it down as a denial of service vulnerability since it would allow me to fill the ```backup.uber.com``` server up with data so that employees would not be able to backup their data. \n\nIn order to patch this you have to go into the settings in CrashPlan and disable \"Inbound backup from other computers\". If you are using this feature, you should add a firewall between ```backup.uber.com``` to block connections not originating from Uber. \n\nI am also reporting this to Code42 (creators of CrashPlan) to suggest that they switch to a secure default. \n\nThanks,\nDavid Dworken","original_report_id":126410,"original_report_url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/126410","attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-05-18T19:18:38.780Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-170360358.2205614,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":912757,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugDuplicate","message":"Thank you for your report.\n\nWe take the security of our users very seriously and appreciate you taking the time to submit this.
