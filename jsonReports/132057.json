(I know this because https://hackerone.com/reports/2147483647 returns 404 but https://hackerone.com/reports/2147483649 returns Error)\n\nWhile https://hackerone.com/reports/-2147483645 returns 404\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/-2147483649 returns Error\n\nTo try this bug, I need to have a verified program. because I can't do that (not sandbox to manipulate rep), I am reporting to you about why I think this works.\n\n- Integers can be from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (~ Â± 2 billion)\n\nIn any programming language, there should be an INT MAX limit. long, short, double... there is. In short:\n```if(INT_MAX+1 \u003e 0)``` is usually true. In your case:\n```if (int(-2147483648) \u003e 0)``` should return **false** which may be a WTF! \n\n-2147483648 is actually an expression: a positive literal value 2147483648 with unary - operator in front of it. Value 2147483648 is apparently too large for the positive side of int range on your platform.\n\nIn short: 2147483647 + 1 is actually -2147483648 and vice versa. **when you pass the MAX in int, it will become negative. and when you pass the negative limit, the number will become posetive**\n\nI am sure by now you are seeing where I am going with this. when an attacker submits too much vulnerabilities and if all are closed by the program as Spam (-10rep) that will give the user a negative reputation. \n\nIf he manages to get enough Spam (can write a script to automate reporting and closing as Spam) he will eventually have enough negative points that pass the int limit and be considered positive.\n\nSo if an attacker manages to do -2147483648 (consider his reputation) - 10 (another report closed as spam) = Positive. *My numbers may not be accurate because of a number of factors* \n\nThis is the oldest trick in the hat while stealing money from banks and sometimes even referenced as Integer Overflow (dont confuse it with the popular c++ bug)\n\nAnyway, take a look and there is more you didnt patch this and I may be right, if so: horry! if not: well, it was a fun writing this.\n\nThanks,\nPaulos","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-05-19T21:42:40.785Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-170265325.2690392,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":6,"voters":["is-","powerjacobb1","mr_sharma_","paulos_","spetr0x","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":913160,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNotApplicable","message":"Hey @paulos_,\n\nI'm guessing you've never bumped into this, but we actually have a hard submission limit of 128 reports per day, which there is no way for a hacker to bypass.

Sure there might be ways to get around our rate limiting, but with things as they are it would only be possible given thousands of years of effort. Just the same, the exploit we would be interested in would be the one that gets around our reputation-oriented rate limiting, rather than just the fact that an integer could hypothetically overflow. Just adding an additional couple of extra points of negative reputation by abusing NMI (which requires the participation of a team) doesn't really go far enough.\n\nAs for closing as not-applicable, I can see where you're coming from. It's a hard decision every time we see a report like this one. I really appreciate the time and effort you put into your write-up, it's well composed, friendly, and articulate. I'm honestly really looking forward to your next report. But on the other hand given the enormous amount of time this would require to be exploited (and even then it's a pretty big if), I think this report is pretty unambiguously not applicable to our program. We get a lot of reports along the line of \"here's a hypothetical but unexploitable vulnerability\", and we want to make sure that we encourage our users to think twice before they submit that kind or report. \n\nUltimately, I hope you'll understand where we're coming from. You have an excellent account, with lots of reputation and a strong signal, so this shouldn't have any significant impact on your overall success.\n\nThanks!\n\n\nEvan","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-04-19T21:33:34.003Z","updated_at":"2016-04-19T21:33:34.003Z","actor":{"username":"ebrynne","cleared":false,"url":"/ebrynne","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/191/f333df32e9b61845f5c823b77d968fa6d246d336_original./fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":915995,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@ebrynne thanks man. it really means a lot. all this effort is to get that awesome hackerone hoodie haha.
