Anyone who has the link can change the rating without logging in simply by changing the ```rating``` parameter at the end of the URL. \n\nSince I ultimately want to publicly disclose this without disclosing my ```trip_token``` and ```trip_uuid``` (which are contained in the link), I put the link in a text file here: [daviddworken.com/uberRating.txt](daviddworken.com/uberRating.txt).

I agree that the token is unguessable (not vulnerable to brute forcing or anything like that), but I question the need for administrators to be able to change the rating left. It is perfectly acceptable for this link to be emailed to users, but should it really be included when the administrator requests a copy of the receipt? It seems like the ability to leave a rating should be restricted to the person who took the ride (rather than their boss). \n\nThanks,\nDavid Dworken","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-04-27T19:36:54.332Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T19:36:54.332Z","actor":{"username":"ddworken","cleared":true,"url":"/ddworken","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/344/0f539160a7134b9d14cd1f9c8e38bbc32c3b3604_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":934695,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"If you are sure that this does not qualify as a vulnerability, can we please disclose this? \n\nThanks, \nDavid Dworken ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-04-30T12:11:40.064Z","updated_at":"2016-04-30T12:11:40.064Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"ddworken","cleared":true,"url":"/ddworken","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/344/0f539160a7134b9d14cd1f9c8e38bbc32c3b3604_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":946063,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Can we please disclose this? \n\nThanks,\nDavid Dworken","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-08T18:42:28.982Z","updated_at":"2016-05-08T18:42:28.982Z","actor":{"username":"ddworken","cleared":true,"url":"/ddworken","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/344/0f539160a7134b9d14cd1f9c8e38bbc32c3b3604_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":953292,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Can we please disclose this?\n\nThanks,\nDavid Dworken","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-12T14:36:45.187Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T14:36:45.187Z","actor":{"username":"ddworken","cleared":true,"url":"/ddworken","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/344/0f539160a7134b9d14cd1f9c8e38bbc32c3b3604_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1087001,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Hey @ddworken, sure thing, sorry for the delay!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-26T00:36:42.853Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T00:36:42.853Z","actor":{"username":"lyoung-uber","cleared":false,"url":"/lyoung-uber","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/079/873/b506b7984a2afcd680a9d5e57f66a0c524760b47_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1087002,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-26T00:36:42.983Z","updated_at":"2016-07-26T00:36:42.983Z","actor":{"username":"lyoung-uber","cleared":false,"url":"/lyoung-uber","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/079/873/b506b7984a2afcd680a9d5e57f66a0c524760b47_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
