You have not published \"DMARC [Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance]\" for the domain paragonie.com more information :-\n\nhttp://dmarc.org/\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\u003e\nwhat is DMARC ?\n\nDMARC, which stands for “Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting \u0026 Conformance”, is a technical specification created by a group of organizations that want to help reduce the potential for email-based abuse by solving a couple of long-standing operational, deployment, and reporting issues \nrelated to email authentication protocols.DMARC standardizes how email receivers perform\nemail authentication using the well-known SPF and DKIM mechanisms. This means that senders will experience consistent authentication results for their messages at AOL, Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! and any \nother email receiver implementing DMARC. We hope this will encourage senders to more broadly authenticate their outbound email which can make email a more reliable way to communicate.\n\nDMARC was aimed at:\n\nReducing false negatives\nProvide authentication reporting\nApply sender policies at the receiving end\nReduce phishing\nBe scalable\nIn order to get started with DMARC, the sending domain needs to have an SPF and DKIM record published. Once the SPF and DKIM records are in place, you can ure DMARC by adding policies to your domain's TXT records (the same way in which you published your SPF and DKIM records). Your TXT record name should read something similar to \"dmarc.your_domain.com.\" Please replace the \"yourdomain.com\" with your own domain.\n\nAs DMARC policies are published as TXT records, it defines what an email receiver should do with non-aligned mail it receives.\n\nYou can read more about creating DMARC records and their uses here:https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/200182958-Everything-about-DMARC-\n\nWhy should you implement this\n\nWhen I try to send a spoofed email from your domain to anyone like from\n\nscott@paragonie.com or security@paragonie.com\nto abcd@example.com`\n\nwhen a domain has DMARC record then they get this\n\nhttp://i.gyazo.com/59c6acf761ff010bb16aa93d19c6fc39.png\n\nThe main point here is that DMARC prevents spoofing by adding this line:\nIt has a from address in mailjet.com but has failed mailjet.com's required tests for authentication.\n\nNow, thats how DMARC comes to rescue\n\nThe following site https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/paragonie.com\n\nGive the follwong detail:\nNo DMARC record published.\n\nWhich shows that you are missing this security feature.\n\nYou should publish a valid DMARC record for your domain to prevent any misunderstanding and to prevent hackers from using your email.\n\nThank you!","weakness":{"id":2,"name":"Memory Corruption - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-05-29T00:51:16.240Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-169476468.88284117,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":932923,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNotApplicable","message":"Hi,\n\nPlease re-read the **[Quick Answers](https://hackerone.com/paragonie)** section of our HackerOne page.
