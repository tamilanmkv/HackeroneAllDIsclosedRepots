details\n=====================\nA vulnerability exists in Flash Player that allows violating the same-origin-policy. An attacker can read sensitive local files and communicate with remote servers. As a result, this allows uploading the content of these local files to an attacker-controlled remote server. In addition, this vulnerability enables an attacker to obtain a user's Windows logon credentials.\n\nOn February 15, I submitted this vulnerability to Mozilla and Adobe.\n\nOn February 16, this vulnerability was confirmed by Jeromie Clark of Adobe.\n\nOn April 26, I received an update from Adobe PSIRT. To mitigate the vulnerability, Adobe will introduce a new feature in Flash Player that will further restrict local filesystem access. This feature will be enabled by default. Adobe expects this feature will be available in Flash Player in Fall 2016.\n\nI understand it is customary issues are resolved and publicly acknowledged before submission to ibb-flash. However, as indicated above, a solution is not expected to arrive before Fall 2016. Considering this is a long time from now, I would like to ask whether my report can be considered for a bug bounty at this time.\n\nShould you decide to take my report into consideration at this time, I can provide a full advisory, including working PoCs for every affected host environment.\n\n\n\nCase IDs\n--------\n**Adobe**: PSIRT-5019\n**Mozilla BMO**: 1248487 / ADBE 4118316\n\n**References at Adobe familiar with this case**:\nJeromie Clark, \u003cjeclark@adobe.com\u003e\nPeleus Uhley, \u003cpuhley@adobe.com\u003e\n\n\n\nAffected host browsers\n----------------------\nAll current versions of:\n- Firefox\n- Chrome\n- Internet Explorer (8 and up)\n- Edge\n- Microsoft Office 2010, 2013 and 2016\n\n\n\nTested with\n-----------\n- Flash Player 20.0.0.306 and up\n- Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10.

From Adobe:\n\u003e\"For security purposes, Flash Player places all local SWF files and assets in the local-with-file-system sandbox, by default. From this sandbox, SWF files can read local files (by using the URLLoader class, for example), but they cannot communicate with the network in any way. This assures the user that local data cannot be leaked out to the network or otherwise inappropriately shared.\" ([Adobe AS3 Developers Guide](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/as3/dev/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118a9b90204-7e3f.html))\n\nHowever, a security vulnerability exists that allows bypassing this sandbox. Using the file:// URI this allows reading local files and communicating with SMB servers. As a result, this allows uploading the content of these local files to an arbitrary remote SMB server, and leaking the Windows account credentials of the user running the Flash Player process.\n\n\nAffected host environments\n---------------------\n\nAll current versions of:\n\n    Firefox\n    Chrome\n    Internet Explorer (8 and up)\n    Edge\n    Microsoft Office 2010, 2013 and 2016\n\n\t\nTested with\n---------------------\n    Flash Player 20.0.0.306 and up\n    Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. All Windows and IE/Edge updates available to date were applied.\n\n\n\nProof of Concept\n---------------------\n\nThe PoC consists of two versions:\n\tpoc_browsers.zip: contains the PoC for the affected host browsers.\n\tpoc_msoffice.zip: contains the PoC for the affected versions of Microsoft Office.\n\t\n\t\n### Steps to reproduce - Browsers\n\n1. Extract poc_browsers.zip somewhere. The ZIP contains two files, \"poc.html\" and \"poc.swf\".\n2. Open \"poc.html\" in Firefox\n3. Observe that the PoC does the following:\n- Opens file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts and reads the file\n- Takes the url file://///192.168.1.100/, appends it with the first 90 bytes of the file above, then makes the SMB request\n\nAs follows from the above the PoC connects to 192.168.1.100. Make sure a Windows machine with an active SMB server is running on that IP. Then use Wireshark to observe that indeed the request is made and received at the target machine. Alternatively, run smbtrap on the target machine (see below for more info).\n\nThe content of the Windows hosts file is printed in the Flash applet. Afterwards, it makes Windows connect to an SMB server that runs on 192.168.1.100.\n- By doing this, Windows exposes the credentials of the currently logged on user to the SMB server. This includes the username as well as an NTLM hash of the user's password. However, this hash can be easily bruteforced, allowing an attacker to retrieve the password. Please see the attached screenshot (smbtrap_win10_winxp.png) in which I use smbtrap to demonstrate this.\n- Having the ability to connect to an SMB server is sufficient to leak the content of an arbitrary local file. This can be done by simply appending the content of the file to the requested URL, like so: \"file://///192.168.1.100/file_content_here/\". These requests can be sniffed by the attacker on the targeted machine, allowing the attacker to retrieve the content of the local file.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce - Microsoft Office\n\n1. Extract poc_msoffice.zip somewhere. The ZIP contains two files: \"poc.docx\" and \"poc.xlsx\".\n2. Open these files in Word or Excel, respectively.\nNote that the PoC consists of one file; the SWF is embedded inside the Office document.\n3. Observe that the PoC does the following:\n- Opens file:///C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts and reads the file\n- Takes the url file://///192.168.2.106/, appends it with the first 90 bytes of the file above, then makes the SMB request\n\n\n### Additional remarks\n- Browser PoC: the SWF could potentially be embedded into the HTML file by means of a data URI. Similar to the Office PoC, having a single file would enable an attacker to distribute it more easily.\n- There are some restrictions on the SMB URL's length. If it is too long, the SMB request will not be completed. For demonstration purposes, this PoC reads and transmits only the first 90 bytes of the Windows hosts file. However, by splitting a file in parts and making a series of SMB requests, one for each part, the entire content of a file can be transferred.\n\nThe attached poc_screenshots.zip contains the following:\n- browser_win10.png, browser_win7.png: Shows the browser PoC on Firefox, Windows 10 and Windows 7.\n- office2013_win81.png: Shows the PoC on Microsoft Office 2013.\n- smbtrap_win10_winxp.png: Smbtrap output for Windows 10 and Windows XP.\n- wireshark_trace.png: Screenshot of a wireshark trace that shows the SMB requests, including one in which a part of the Windows hosts file was sent.\n\n\nReferences\n---------------------\nSmbtrap -
