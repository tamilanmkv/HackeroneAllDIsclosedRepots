You can see it by yourself on reports 137508, 132450 and 138662 (Three different ways of exploiting this vulnerability)\n\nWhy is this a vulnerability?\n======================\nA malicious individual could very well leverage this vulnerability to prevent a legitimate user from accessing the report. In addition, it causes an unnecessary load on Hackerone's servers, since it can be used as a request amplification attack, by issuing a large amount of requests to the report, once it's filled with random info. Also, even though compression techniques can be used to reduce the amount of data transferred, this can by greatly bypassed by issuing high-entropy data (random), which would hinder the compression mechanisms.\n\nHow to fix this?\n=============\nSeveral ideas come to mind:\n- Limit the amount of consecutive comments that can be seen at once in a report, providing a \"see more\" button which will at most overload the client interface, not the server.\n- Limit the amount of data sent per comment, providing a \"see more\" button which loads the following chunk of data.\n- When a high amount of comment load is detected (either because of a high amount of comments or big comments being sent), perform a CAPTCHA check.\n\nAs you can see on the following screenshot, the report failed to load: {F95556}\n\nThis is the request made by the Ajax controller: {F95557}\n\nThis is the response sent by the server, showing a gateway error after 60 seconds: {F95558}","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial

Here's a little more elaboration on why we're not treating this as a security issue.\n1) Protecting against rogue users with legitimate access harming their own content is generally beyond the purview of our bug bounty program. Therein lies madness. \n2) As you mentioned, worst case here is that the non-malicious users contact our support channel when they can't load the report, and then we fix it for them. This doesn't hide the report, it just makes its content unavailable.\n3) A researcher hiding a publicly disclosed bug totally sucks, but again falls more under the category of functional bug than security risk.\n\nIn regards to the reports you linked for precedent, I knew about them, and admittedly that bothered me. This kinda bug is pretty close to the threshold of a legit vulnerability and even though we try really _really_ hard to be consistent, having different engineers coming on and off security duty means inevitable quirks like this. To make sure that doesn't happen again I started a larger conversation with the team, and the firm consensus was that this is a purely functional issue and we should stick to that going forwards. The second part of that is that we also have something of a trend of resolving and even rewarding the first report of a functional bug (even if we don't fix it immediately), so thankfully we've been even more consistent about not resolving reports of this nature in recent months. \n\nI hope that makes sense, and just let me know if you have any more questions.\n\nThanks!\n\n\nEvan \n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-27T01:23:44.391Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T01:23:44.391Z","actor":{"username":"ebrynne","cleared":false,"url":"/ebrynne","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/191/f333df32e9b61845f5c823b77d968fa6d246d336_original./fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":986876,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Oh well, I won't deny that it is a bit dissapointing and I usually base myself on both previous reports and the bounty program guidelines, in order to measure the threshold that one must meet with a vulnerability so it can be considered.
