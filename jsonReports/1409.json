As an example, please see [this link](http://fct.li/?url=https://172.18.64.13). As you will see, it returns the HTML of your Chef server (which, I assume, cannot be accessed from the internet). I wasn't able to access any of your systems. That being said, I didn't really spent time on it.\r\n\r\nPlease note that once your proxy is also able to follow redirects, it should reject redirects to internal hosts as well.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-05-07T22:07:45.314Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-234459186.16307247,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":5,"voters":["realtess","eveeez","spetr0x","cryptosector","sigma22"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6921,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Will fix!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-02-14T13:07:48.612Z","updated_at":"2014-02-14T13:07:48.612Z","actor":{"username":"markijbema","cleared":false,"url":"/markijbema","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/001/704/902185099ec49b8635411a783a27eedc6a52cd05_original.gif/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"factlink","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":11423,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I was a bit too enthousiastic.
