Uber, \n\nThanks for re-thinking the scenario, This Issue exisist with the design, where a Driver can invite another Driver through SMS\n\nAttack Scenario:\n\nFake Driver (Attacker-Not Verfied) Invited another People (Might Be politician's, Business Man, or a DoNot Disturb Member, or the User is in Roaming where Each SMS will chanrged) has given the Mobile number to Uber to generate the Invite Message, The Attacker what extra did here he just queeed the SMS Message, and relaxed\n\nNo What Uber is doing Bad here is , it's sending Every Day 60 SMS Message to people and disturbing their privacy, People usually ignore 1 SMS message , but when you will recieve 60 SMS every day they will get frustrated too and can reach to TRAI or Provider to bring Law in place\n\nI was a Vicitm of this flood, as I used my own number to re-produce this Scenrio, I need to then talked to the Uber Support to stopped the flood through twitter \n\nUsually SMS will triggered from 9:30 AM IST, since SMS content length is high it comes as three part, and Normal distribution is 20 message * 3 Part result in 60 SMS,    __This can be very dangerous when a mass population is affected , as people Mobile Number is in DND or roaming (Each SMS will charged), and can be booked Against DND Act__\n \nI request to re-open this Issue, as a legal Issue to be addressed\n\n\n__Mitigation__:\nThis feature should be given to Verfied Driver, as this reduce attack surface, and will be under Law, Uber can claim who generated the SMS Message\nThe Uber should verify whether the same number is Used or not
