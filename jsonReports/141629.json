Can you confirm that the bug is fixed? Thanks!\n\nLet me also elaborate why I asked you to report this to our bug bounty program: with this issue, you are able to add team members outside of your program to your own group. The front-end does not reflect that the person is actually part of the group. This means that, in case that group is assigned to a bug, someone outside of your program would still receive notifications of that report (which would leak the report title), even if the original team member was removed from the program. This could've been used as backdoor to keep getting updates of a program, even after being removed from the program.\n\nBecause you pointed us in the right direction, we will reward you for this find and acknowledge you in our hall of fame.

again!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-31T16:14:47.295Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T16:14:47.295Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":992892,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-31T16:15:05.052Z","updated_at":"2016-05-31T16:15:05.052Z","actor":{"url":"/security","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/013/fa942b9b1cbf4faf37482bf68458e1195aab9c02_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"HackerOne"}},"bounty_amount":"500.0","bounty_currency":"usd","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","collaborator":{"username":"pardeepbattu02","url":"/pardeepbattu02"},"actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":996242,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks
