In my research, I found that a user supplied CSRF Token would be accepted and even saved in the browser cookie and will be the set token on subsequent request. This report is limited to the `Register` and `Login` page anyway.\nAnd most importantly, there is no verification of the `CSRF token` on the `server side` because if there is, the request shouldn't go through to talk of being saved in the browser cookie. The only verification I can see is if the inserted token is more than set 32 characters.\n\nPoC:\n- Navigate to https://sandbox.veris.in/portal/register/\n- Fill the form and the captcha as required\n- Using a proxy tool, intercept the request (I'm using Burp Proxy)\n- Change the value of `csrftoken` in cookie field\n- Copy the same input and paste in `csrfmiddlewaretoken`\n- Forward the request\n- You'll get a 200 OK response\ni.e Request made successfull\n- In the next request, change the value of `csrftoken` to the one used recently. \n- You could now check the value of cookie in the browser. \n- Bam! You found it.\n\nI can provide a video proof if needed. I hope you understand\n\nThanks\nShuaib Oladigbolu","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":5,"voters":["footstep","temmyscript","fantam1","spetr0x","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1004487,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks @footstep for the report.
