Please login with the new Password.\",\"userRole\":\"client\",\"userWorkflow\":\"PASSWORDLESS_SIGNUP\"}\n```\n\n# To replicate\n1. Create a new Rider account (I used the iOS app, but this probably does not matter).\n2. Replay the request shown above, changing the phoneNumberE164 field with the phone number you associated with your account (including country prefix and the plus sign, for example, +1xxx for US). You might need to replay it twice. You'll eventually get the \"New password has been created.\" message; the new password has been set. The new password will be whatever you specified in the newPassword field in the request.\n3. Login using the new password on http://riders.uber.com/ or elsewhere.","bounty_amount":"10000.0","formatted_bounty":"$10,000","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-07-28T16:22:55.193Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-164236733.93606576,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":289,"voters":["irvinlim","m4t35z","lukasreschke","static","jokebookservice1","fern","nytr0gen","arneswinnen","jensec","tomdev","and 279 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1004867,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks for the report @mongo, I have confirmed and triaged.
