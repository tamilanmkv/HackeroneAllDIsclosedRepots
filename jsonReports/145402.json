We have updated this one here, so people don't need to read up on our dedicated security page for that.\n\nThe reason we're at the moment excluding malicious third-party applications is the fact that they require a very high level of user interaction to be installed and the architecture of our app is not properly protecting data in these cases.\n\nThe Nextcloud Android client can be used to download and upload files to your Nextcloud instance. At the moment files downloaded are simply stored in the public accessible data area of the Android phone. Thus any other app can access the data. There is work on-going for adding a Content Provider though. \n\nAlso, as soon as somebody has physical access to a device one can normally assume that an attacker is able to extract any data. Especially if they're anyways able to sideload arbitrary apps.\n\n\u003e If you still think that this is not an issue at your side, then kindly publicly disclose the issue!\n\nAbsolutely.
