If we take the definition of the word \"vulnerability\" from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)#Definitions the general consensus is that a vulnerability is something that allows somebody to escalate their permission.\n\nHackerOne defines a vulnerability in their [Disclosure Guidelines](https://hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines) the following:\n\n\u003e **Vulnerability:** A software bug that would allow an attacker to perform an action in violation of an expressed security policy. *A bug that enables escalated access or privilege is a vulnerability.* Design flaws and failures to adhere to security best practices may qualify as vulnerabilities. Weaknesses exploited by viruses, malicious code, and social engineering are not considered vulnerabilities unless the Security Team says otherwise in the program's policy.\n\nOur belief is that that this specific issue may qualify as regular functional bug but not as vulnerability per se. As per our [threat model](https://nextcloud.com/security/threat-model/) (which is [tracked in Git](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud.com/blob/master/page-threat-model.php)) an administrator is considered an ultimate trusted unit. \n\nConsidering that administrators can for example execute arbitrary code by applying some theming settings, mounting local storage and so on this is simply not part of our documented threat model.\n\n--- \nAnyhow, we'd like to thank you for reporting this back to us.
