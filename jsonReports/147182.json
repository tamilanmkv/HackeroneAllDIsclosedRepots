Go to sign up form.\n2. Enter Any Email.\n3. Create account\n* The Account will be activated with any email verification!\n\nHow to fix?\n-------------------\nEmail verification/validation should be required when a user changed email from user settings page..\n\nI hope you'll fix it soon. :-)\n\nThanks,\nAhsan Tahir","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial of Service"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-07-28T00:31:46.030Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-164293894.37812752,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":10,"voters":["realtess","ahsan","sa1tama0","rojansec","spetr0x","computerk","h1000h1","akashroxx","dyabla","louislane"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1036715,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Sorry, the steps of replication are wrong in the above report..\n\nNew steps to reproduce (corrected):\n---------------------------------\n1.
