They can be useful with a vulnerability (i.e. SQLi + FPD + `INTO OUTFILE` = reverse shell), but don't really give an attacker much that they couldn't infer from trial and error.\n\nI almost always use some variant of `/var/www/projectname/public_html` for document roots. In CSPR.NG's case, it's `/var/www/csprng/src/public`. Our company's website is in `/var/www/paragonie/public`. And so on)\n\nThis bug is only going to be triggered by debug mode being enabled (which it is, on CSPR.NG). Even without the existence of this bug, the full path disclosure is still going to happen from the debug mode stack trace caused by the exception being thrown.\n\nWhen debug mode is off, the exception isn't thrown. Instead, the `$this-\u003epost()` call simply returns false and the POST data is ignored completely.\n\nThanks for taking the time to poke around Airship.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-08T14:55:08.237Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T14:55:08.237Z","actor":{"username":"paragonie-scott","cleared":false,"url":"/paragonie-scott","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/051/441/089de22b2f1b80a1e57a2792318dede5cbad81db_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"paragonie","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1059638,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-08T14:55:13.843Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T14:55:13.843Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"paragonie-scott","cleared":false,"url":"/paragonie-scott","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/051/441/089de22b2f1b80a1e57a2792318dede5cbad81db_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"paragonie","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1059686,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ManuallyDisclosed","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-08T15:13:02.109Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T15:13:02.109Z","actor":{"username":"paragonie-scott","cleared":false,"url":"/paragonie-scott","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/051/441/089de22b2f1b80a1e57a2792318dede5cbad81db_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"paragonie","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1059723,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Yup I agree, glad I could help, I'll poke around a bit more if I have the time","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-08T15:27:14.590Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T15:27:14.590Z","actor":{"username":"velby","cleared":false,"url":"/velby","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"paragonie","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
