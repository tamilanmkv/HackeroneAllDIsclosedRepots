However, you are now using the attr method to define the image source. This is safer although it's conceivable that an attacker could now use \"javascript:alert(100);\" as the image source in the URL, after which your code defines this as the source of the image. From what I've gleaned from various internet resources, an XSS attack in the form of \u003cimg src=\"javascript:......\"\u003e is obsolete now in modern browsers (and I can confirm it doesn't work in my recent versions of Firefox and Chrome), but it used to be a feasible vector in older ones.\n\nI don't know what your policy is in regard to old browsers and their inherent flaws. If you want to secure yourself against attacks against the entire spectrum of browsers old and new, the above might be worth investigating.
