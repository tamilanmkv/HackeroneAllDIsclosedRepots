From any open to buy ticket sign up for one.\n2. In the *First name , Last name* field type `=AND(2\u003e1)` and `=7*7` respectively.\n3. Save them.\n4. Now from admin panel export the attendees information as CSV. Open the CSV with any application (eg. Excel) and you'll see the First name and Last name field executes the command.\nThis can be further used to perform command execution on Windows system (high risk)\n[See this](http://www.contextis.com/resources/blog/comma-separated-vulnerabilities/)\nSince the bug could be exploited by random user and the victim is admin, I think it should be patched.\n\nThe **Fix** could be simple. Just escape `=` and `-` `+` signs from user input. this will solve the issue I guess.\n\nHope you resolve and reward.\n\n------------------------------\nZawad","bounty_amount":"375.0","formatted_bounty":"$375","weakness":{"id":58,"name":"Command Injection - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-09-17T01:16:16.185Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-159884915.1508074,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":15,"voters":["sameerphad72","0nlymohammed","thezawad","zawad","ahsan","japz","spetr0x","zeroknife","dyabla","satishc23","and 5 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1070860,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi Zawad, thanks for the report!
