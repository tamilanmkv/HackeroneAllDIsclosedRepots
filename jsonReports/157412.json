The value can only be a number though.\n\n```\nmysql\u003e select * from wp_postmeta where meta_key = \"test\";\n+---------+----------+------------+\n| post_id | meta_key | meta_value |\n+---------+----------+------------+\n|  100000 | test     | 42         |\n+---------+----------+------------+\n```\n\nThis can be used by attacker to alter behavior of plugins and themes. For example:\n * I removed background image from https://www.secnews.gr/100000 by setting `_bg_color_override` to `1` in the post meta.\n * I set shares count to `-56994` at https://www.secnews.gr/100000 by changing `mashsb_shares` and `mashsb_timestamp` meta of the post.\n\nPotentially this can be used to:\n * Change booleans, counters and timestamps in other plugins leading to information disclosure or website defacement.\n * Unnoticeably fill the database with garbage data until the disk space is full.\n\nAffected posts\n---\n\nWhile looking for vulnerabilities I changed some meta for posts 95513, 100000 and 104030. You can clean it up with something like this:\n`DELETE * FROM wp_postmeta WHERE post_id IN (95513, 100000, 104030) AND meta_key IN ('_bg_color_override', 'mashsb_shares', 'mashsb_timestamp');`","bounty_amount":"300.0","formatted_bounty":"$300","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege Escalation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-09-08T05:57:51.871Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-160645724.5473082,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":2,"voters":["bugdiscloseguys","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1111413,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Dear sir, our committee will check the above description and we will come back to you the soonest possible.
