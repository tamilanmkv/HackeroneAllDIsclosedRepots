They fixed this issue few months back by adding a process that asks users whether user want to close all open sessions or not right after changing password.\n\nSo there is two way, either you let users to choose if they want to keep active sessions or just destroy every active sessions when an users change his/her password!\n\nPlease Fix This Vulnerability AND let me know.\nLooking forward to hear from you.\nBest Regards,","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":1,"voters":["dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1112766,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Thanks for your report.
