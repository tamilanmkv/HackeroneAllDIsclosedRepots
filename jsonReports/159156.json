However, it's good that we found out about this issue early so we could resolve it before further use. As such, we are awarding a bounty based on possible future use.\n\nNote that no HackerOne data was affected by this issue, as this is on a separate domain (`hacker.one` vs `hackerone.com`).\n\nWe want to reiterate for the future that it's important that you only test for security issues using your own accounts or documented test accounts/instances, as any such defacement of an active service can be
