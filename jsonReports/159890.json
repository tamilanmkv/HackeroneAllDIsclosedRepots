it in two files \nF112672 =\u003e works well on Windows\nF112671 =\u003e works well on Linux\n\nThe output of the script would be like :\n\n{F112668}\n{F112670}\n\nBasically it records the date and time of every newly submitted report , of course that can be improved to generate hourly or daily reports about the platform activities , when hackers are mostly active , how frequent reports are submitted on H1 and so on , all is normally undisclosed information , only platform operator should know about .\n\n##Impact :\n\nI think it's too permissive for a highly secure platform to leave a way open for third parties to track its activity and its user interactions with the platform , which considered as privilege information only platform operators should be allowed to get their hands onto .\n\nThank you guys , glad that I've learned something new today specifically for this report , hope it qualifies and worth addressing . \n\nBest regards ,\nThanks

@saeedhashem,\n\nWhy do you feel this is a security issue? Specifically,\n- Are you able to track which users are interacting with the platform and/or specific reports?\n- Are you able to track which programs are receiving the reports?\n- Are you able to obtain any sensitive information that can be used against HackerOne or any of its customers?\n\nIf none of the above apply, we can't consider the behavior to be a security issue because there are many, many other things you can track if you tried. For example,\n- What user/program handles have been claimed\n- What reports are being disclosed\n- How many reports are being resolved, how many hackers are being thanked, or how many programs have become public (these are actually explicitly listed on the home page https://hackerone.com/)","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-17T01:17:23.991Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T01:17:23.991Z","actor":{"username":"andrewone","cleared":false,"url":"/andrewone","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/015/236/a5d3675b5d06cc936fbcc467cc8643e779371f3a_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1130941,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Thanks for your quick response .\n\nAs I've mentioned in the `Impact` section , this monitoring frequency of reports' submission explicitly describes how active or inactive the platform is  , usually this information isn't public .\n\nThe other mentioned traceable incidents are intentionally left public and don't have any specific meaning in and by themselves , unlike the behaviour in this report , which I believe it's not intentionally allowed .\n\nPlease , consider consulting one or more other team members if they agree or disagree with you , just to be sure that I'm fairly assessed .\n\nIf you disagree you can just close the report , as informative if I may request .\n\nThanks for your time .","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-17T01:41:18.344Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T01:41:18.344Z","actor":{"username":"saeedhashem","cleared":false,"url":"/saeedhashem","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/043/028/c3aeff767740154872720169f486cd81bf40dc9a_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1131014,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"If I may refer to this specific report #127620 , it is not typically the same but but they are some how similar .\n\nThe explanation was that the disclosure of metadata about undisclosed report .\n\nLet's say that I submitted a duplicate bug , and the team assigned the original report to the duplicate status but didn't add me to the original report , now I know the report Id and if I have a log of every report's submission time using the reported behaviour , then I would know  the report's submission time and date and knew that it belongs to this or that program  , which considered as \"Meta data\" about undisclosed report , data that's not supposed to be public .\n\nI don't usually like to refer to other disclosed reports to justify my point of view , but I thought it might somehow clear things up regarding this situation . \n\n Thanks ,","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-17T03:03:43.656Z","updated_at":"2016-08-17T03:06:06.383Z","actor":{"username":"saeedhashem","cleared":false,"url":"/saeedhashem","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/043/028/c3aeff767740154872720169f486cd81bf40dc9a_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1131021,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNotApplicable","message":"Hi @saeedhashem,\n\nEven if you did log all that information, you wouldn't have the information that #127620 was leaking (the combined team, reporter, and ID).

There's nothing sensitive about that particular information, and while perhaps it could be used to gain some better insights into how researchers work, it doesn't actually leak specific information about the reports, the teams, or even the reporters. #127620 is focused solely on metadata that should not be public yet.\n\nAs there is no security issue here, I am closing this as N/A.
