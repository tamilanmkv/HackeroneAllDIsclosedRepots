The code was being executed for unauthenticated visitors\n1. The code is relying on nonces for authorization instead of using `current_user_can()`\n1. The site is either a) Running WP 3.3.x or older and hasn't defined custom `NONCE_SALT`/`NONCE_KEY` values; or b) Has their web server incorrectly configured such that their `wp-config.php` file does not get parsed by the PHP engine and can be read plain-text by making an HTTP request to its URL\n\nThe situation with CampTix is very different, though.\n\n1. The Notify tool can only be used by authenticated users who have administrative privileges. This means that `$token` will be a CSPRN.\n1. CampTix is using nonces properly. They're used to verify *intention* (i.e., to protect against CSRF), not to verify *authorization* (which is the job of `current_user_can()`). \n\nThe crux of the vulnerability that the article described is that 3rd piece, though. That's not something CampTix has any control over; it depends entirely on how the individual site has configured their web server and their `wp-config.php` file, and whether or not they're running a very old version of WordPress. \n\nPersonally, I think that those conditions are much more uncommon than the article's author claims, and I'm confident that they're extremely rare in professionally-run sites. Further, if you could read `wp-config.php`, you could do far worse things than CSRF in CampTix, like creating a new admin user in the database, read hashed passwords from the db and easily crack them, use CSRF to add a new admin user, etc.\n\nI think if there is an exploit here, it wouldn't just be a vulnerability in CampTix, it would be a vulnerability in WordPress Core, and every plugin that uses nonces in the way they're meant to be used.\n\nI'm happy to be proven wrong, though. If you can generate a correct nonce for the Notify action on https://testing.wordcamp.org then I'll definitely accept this (even if don't perform the social engineering component).\n\nOtherwise, I think this can be closed as `Not applicable`.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-19T01:29:33.353Z","updated_at":"2016-08-19T01:29:33.353Z","actor":{"username":"iandunn","cleared":false,"url":"/iandunn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/974/01bc1d097002b7eff8eddba98990e094553b1eac_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"iandunn-projects","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1152362,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNotApplicable","message":"I'm gonna go ahead and close this since you haven't responded, but if you think there's still a vulnerability please let me know and I can re-open it.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-24T18:46:29.224Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T18:46:29.224Z","actor":{"username":"iandunn","cleared":false,"url":"/iandunn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/974/01bc1d097002b7eff8eddba98990e094553b1eac_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"iandunn-projects","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1152363,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-24T18:46:45.082Z","updated_at":"2016-08-24T18:46:45.082Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"iandunn","cleared":false,"url":"/iandunn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/974/01bc1d097002b7eff8eddba98990e094553b1eac_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"iandunn-projects","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1220157,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ManuallyDisclosed","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-09-27T21:45:12.184Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T21:45:12.184Z","actor":{"username":"iandunn","cleared":false,"url":"/iandunn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/974/01bc1d097002b7eff8eddba98990e094553b1eac_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"iandunn-projects","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
