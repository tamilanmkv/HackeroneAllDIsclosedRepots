There turns out to be an IDOR vulnerability when creating a list based on a label. An attacker can create a list with a label ID that belongs to a private repository. This leaks the name and description of the label to the attacker.\n\n# Proof of concept\n- Create a new, private repository\n- In the created repository, create a new label - lets assume it has label ID 1\n- Create another repository, doesn't matter if it's a private or public repository, and doesn't have to be scoped under the same namespace\n- In the created repository, create another new label - lets assume it has label ID 2\n- Go to the board of the repository created in step 3, and intercept your network traffic\n- Click the label created and notice similar to the one below being sent to the GitLab instance:\n\n**Request**\n```\nPOST /jobertabma/test/board/lists HTTP/1.1\nHost: gitlab-instance\n...\n\n{\"list\":{\"label_id\":2}}\n```\n\n**Response**\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\n\n{\"id\":3,\"list_type\":\"label\",\"position\":1,\"title\":\"super secret title\",\"label\":{\"id\":1,\"title\":\"super secret title\",\"color\":\"#428BCA\",\"description\":null,\"priority\":null}}\n```\n\n - In the request, change the `label_id` to 1, or any other label ID that doesn't belong to you and forward the request.\n - Refresh the board page, notice the created list - it contains the label name and description\n\n# Fix\nThis is a very ugly solution, but I just wanted to include it to point you to the vulnerability LoC. Line 18 (or 20, after the fix), creates a `List` object without making sure the provided `label_id` belongs to the project.\n\n```\ndiff --git i/app/services/boards/lists/create_service.rb w/app/services/boards/l\nindex 5cb408b..630b05a 100644\n--- i/app/services/boards/lists/create_service.rb\n+++ w/app/services/boards/lists/create_service.rb\n@@ -15,6 +15,8 @@ module Boards\n       end\n\n       def create_list_at(position)\n+        params[:label_id] = project.labels.find(params[:label_id]).id\n+\n         board.lists.create(params.merge(list_type: :label, position: position))\n       end\n     end\n```","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-10-02T08:03:00.539Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-158564710.53892443,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":9,"voters":["michiel","eveeez","fantam1","spetr0x","hackworld","dyabla","cryptosector","rashedul_css","vasuvetri"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1144941,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"@jobert Thanks for the report.
