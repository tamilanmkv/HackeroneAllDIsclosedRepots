As any authenticated Windows user is allowed to\ncreate new folders at the system drive's root, the expected folder structure can be created by anyone. \n\nThis enables any local user to create the expected OpenSSL config file. Using this config file it is then possible to instruct OpenSSL to load additional libraries. This finally leads to arbitrary code execution in other user's slack.exe process. This is especially a problem as Slack is automatically started after logging in.\n\nHere's a video illustrating the attack: https://owncloud.bogner.sh/s/MRXZSp0YyfK9ycf\nAdditionally you can download the source code and the binary version of the used payloads here: https://owncloud.bogner.sh/s/z7kbZr9STr08R73\n\nTo fix this vulnerability the OpenSSL config file should only be loaded from secure locations (like somewhere from within the application's root folder)\n\nIf you have any questions just let me know.\nFlorian","bounty_amount":"750.0","formatted_bounty":"$750","weakness":{"id":58,"name":"Command Injection - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":114492,"file_name":"Screen_Shot_2016-08-24_at_09.48.52.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/114/492/5593935fbce2c828dcde2d853a4e161865617f5f/Screen_Shot_2016-08-24_at_09.48.52.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Screen_Shot_2016-08-24_at_09.48.52.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Screen_Shot_2016-08-24_at_09.48.52.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQVIDF5ZMX%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T134815Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDQQQUuKj8T5pdoqR2Krp3zajoi1gg54vXvD2Ne1FwhmAIhAKKfb3UfAQbrUu4HHC%2B4UyMY7m5fBTHvtLlTV0hUevF7KoMECO7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5Igy%2F64SgTlh6KUEnD5Uq1wMsL4Z6ljP60c3R7lO1zjypi9biR2g5iQoP%2FT3s6lOKdbpGuE3RHjMeja9YKKN7goc11u6bYdonocyi6RU8RN2An2aRnhfVo3l%2FZlMwpffUbu5JHc7OKmtZqUXTysPRszIl1CCSQ50yZBwtNWg%2Fxavv6bNKeHjCjYNwQxGBqC%2ByBW24czUMzGzaD5uFMoYGAMoWIxFJ6iHFG8UfXfoB1shKsZ3jkdkCp2MI12RtkuUec%2F0QW%2BSUqdLWUg2p3%2B1H%2FJaoFmNN5Utibk4elkj5kRmoejx7EnpbtxcHN1J6Ccb1mMlapHFqvmkcjE8fLu3vLMoRZX0qMhHcbtwHM4mmdbMGDcLaK4ZzuGUfKK3tlGfzyb%2BJEOYnCFd1OBdp9DB9bhiSMWyc1JifbNweT%2F1X1i3QMSQ%2BviuXf%2Bxvep9dRJ8nErGx9JdRp3yS8jCqdzkSh9FhreaRloo4jHkFXz72rd1zbbphih0VnX1T1kREihWx9RKRGpfOf2ct6w59fDThEMiXM7%2B1ZWMP1qPO2XDz8hAqeQqURPDe5AmiGn%2FZKFThe%2F8xzj0%2B5M2W36t3rKudZmsfzk9t0V0gZgIgIqXzHYE871rDImxmRy6q2HeWGIt10F1JC%2Fc9vpEwvO6QiwY6pAFAIHM092pG3M%2B23%2BPi00SqMMlTN%2FebpZH7d1Rq7%2BpDNNT62MHysMiTIJwmN0mj3cgRIiDLQKqFPlp97hcSQcDzJF%2F5WJ%2FSpWbDFtqVjRTP9eZ3KoMBEOEbvq2IGUFF14lCJNIXEj03clafpnnHjjr5akYILvb51xnKlHai4iTUO00TgVrv5%2FXDjYcFV06nU8YCB3mUWnDHCpTI6c%2BltGO9Yt9pxQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=911925a374d9b4d66d0d7a8c751d1f464502e4c55056077f130b66300ad2f410","file_size":54588,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-07-14T19:01:03.862Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-133901231.3391222,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":14,"voters":["sp1d3rs","stefanofinding","bl4de","spam404","0xsyndr0me","fbogner","nate4020","xiaoyinl","pappan","eveeez","and 4 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1154337,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Thank you for your very interesting report!\n\nWe can confirm the behavior you describe, however, after discussing this internally, it seems that exploiting this behavior would be quite difficult without either another vulnerability on the system or direct physical access to the machine.
