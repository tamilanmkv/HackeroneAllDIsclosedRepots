When we see an issue like this, we have to jump on it quick. Thanks for spotting this!\n\nSome background on the issue: we use a javascript framework called Meteor. In Meteor, data is sent to clients via websockets through publishing/subscribing. The server side rules for our publish method for the Users collection was overly broad and we were publishing everything. This should have been restricted to admin users only. So, we've put in the fix and our continuous integration build is running now. The issue should be patched in about 4-5 minutes.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-26T02:30:08.759Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T02:30:08.759Z","actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1155016,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"This is also happening with document information, leaking the titles, which makes sense based on what you said.
