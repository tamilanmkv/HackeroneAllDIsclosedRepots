To explain it a little more. Your client hits our CDN, our CDN has a wildcard certificate that hosts multiple domains on their cert, then the CDN caches and proxies to our load balancer with our own certificate. What you're seeing is the connection to the CDN. Now we can't fix our CDN at the moment unless we move off of them nor change their certificate. \n\nIf you change your hosts file name for app.relateiq.com to elb-app-prod-vpc-public3-1178699437.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com do you still get the issue?

What yo describe would still mean that *I* initiate a connection to your server. However, the feature I am discussing here is that YOU (your server, loadbalancer, whatever) is initiating a connection to the outside world. With initiating the connection I speak of TCP a SYN. As you can see in my first posting the IP 54.218.20.199 (relate to Amazon) connects from a high (client) TCP port to a low TCP port (443) on my server.\n\nTo maybe start from the very beginning ... when you register an account with your system - you can chose to use an exchange account (office365). Within that setting you can say \"show advance options\". In this option you can define to which exchange a connection should be made (please see the screenshot in the first post too). The connection which is made at THAT point does not validate the certificate.\n\nI have really no idea how other/better I could explain the issue. However, I believe it is a very serious issue, because the SSL connection could be tampered without your system realizing it putting all client data (including domain passwords) at risk which uses custom connections ... therefore, in case you do not understand (no offense please, it is probably my reporting style ...)  what I've found here, maybe another colleague from you could cross check and re-read the issue? \n\nThanks\n\npUm\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-18T16:54:34.521Z","updated_at":"2014-06-18T16:56:25.119Z","actor":{"username":"pum","cleared":false,"url":"/pum","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/007/283/1b173be2ad7b39fe302f8c49f403219c3bb1bd99_original.PNG/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"relateiq","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":79367,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi,\n\ncan I ask on an update for this issue?
