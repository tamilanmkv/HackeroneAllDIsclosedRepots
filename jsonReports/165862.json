Make sure you have two apps __A__ and **B**\n2. In **A** create a retainer, let's say it has id `1234`.\n3. In **B** open this link:\n    https://SUBDOMAIN.harvestapp.com/invoices/new?invoice[client_id]=5678\u0026invoice[kind]=retainer\u0026invoice[retainer_id]=1234\n\n\n    Here _5678_ needs to be a valid client id for account **B**. Then simply fill out the invoice form and save it.\n\n4. Now in account **A** go to `https://[SUBDOMAIN].harvestapp.com/retainers/1234` and you will see that the invoice from account **B** was added to this retainer.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege Escalation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-10-29T16:11:30.228Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-156202682.7393173,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":22,"voters":["michiel","bogdantcaciuc","spam404","yaworsk","flashdisk","bugdiscloseguys","gamliel","madrobot","th3g3nt3lman","ak1t4","and 12 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1182274,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi Edgar,\n\nThanks for this one!
