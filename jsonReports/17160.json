To avoid the risk of stealing/bruteforcing password. (For example, by see the \"Username/Name\" of the victim!)\r\n\r\nNote: Yes, is right the question that some users asked \"How anyone can know that what's your password\"..This is only an important pratice that some important sites adopt to reduce the risk of the password stealing and I think that a site like Slack should consider it.\r\n\r\nAs I told you, this is a password policy issue..(\"Password can contains etc boablaba\"), you can check it here: http://www.comptechdoc.org/independent/security/policies/password-policy.html\r\n\r\nSee the 16 point..of \"4.0 Password Protection\" section:\r\n\r\n\"Don't use part of your login name in your password. \"\r\n\r\nIn some cases..by consider these words..\"Don't use part of your login name in your password.\" some users decided independent to choose a password with same characters of the username \"..but I think that, normally..a site, have to \"tells and advertise\" them that it's recommend to use a different password from the username!\r\n\r\nMy point is that some time it not depends from you the user choice but I think that by telling them the right way to choose, is the best solution\r\n\r\nI think that by these words, you understand what the problem is.\r\n\r\nWait a reply ASAP,\r\n\r\nBr,\r\n\r\nSimone","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-09-04T09:23:05.423Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-224137694.6064814,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":2,"voters":["hkr0","dayaar"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":77355,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks for reporting this.
