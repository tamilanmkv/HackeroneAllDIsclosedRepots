This could be achieved by using the new HTML5 standard entities such as `\u0026NewLine;` `\u0026Tab;` `\u0026colon;`\n\n### PoC\nRun the following piece of code under CI framework\n```\necho $this-\u003esecurity-\u003exss_clean('\u003ca href=\"javascript\u0026NewLine;\u0026colon;eval(String.fromCharCode(97, 108, 101, 114, 116, 40, 100, 111, 99, 117, 109, 101, 110, 116, 46, 100, 111, 109, 97, 105, 110, 41));\"\u003eXSS Link\u003c/a\u003e');\n```\n**For a demo**\n1. Go to http://www.aorank.com/tutorial/codeigniter_xss_clean/index.php/form/ (*a demo of a tutorial illustrating xss_clean();*)\n2. In employee name's field, enter\n ```\n\u003ca href=\"javascript\u0026NewLine;\u0026colon;eval(String.fromCharCode(97, 108, 101, 114, 116, 40, 100, 111, 99, 117, 109, 101, 110, 116, 46, 100, 111, 109, 97, 105, 110, 41));\"\u003eXSS Link\u003c/a\u003e\n```\n3. Submit the form\n4. The payload is injected into the page and XSS vector is triggered as soon as user clicks the link.\n\n### Why?\nActually the website was using an old version of xss_clean() that did not take the new standard entities into consideration. However, when I downloaded the latest version of CI to see if this is fixed, I noticed that you check if they exist and handle them accordingly but there is a flaw in the regular expression used to detect standard entities that causes the XSS bypass.\n\nIn line 677 in ./system/core/Security.php\n`if (preg_match_all('/\u0026[a-z]{2,}(?![a-z;])/i', $str, $matches))`\n\nWe can see that this regular expression matches alpha characters preceded by ampersand (\u0026) and **not followed** by a semi-colon (;) --*I have no idea why you do this BTW, since entities are usually followed by a semicolon :D*--\n\nSo when user injects `\u0026NewLine;` and/or `\u0026Tab;` they are not detected by the regular expression and hence not converted to their corresponding characters. That's why the XSS filter fails to detect the presence `javascript:` in the attribute.\n\n### Remediation\nRegular expression should be fixed to count for entities followed by a semi-colon :))\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon ^_^\n\nSincerely,\nAbood Nour\n","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-12-04T02:22:32.837Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-153142127.76096722,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":20,"voters":["michiel","flashdisk","mdv","xsam","an0nym0us","ibram","apapedulimu","m16","ymy","ajdumanhug","and 10 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1218182,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi,\n\nI cannot reproduce this with our latest released version - 3.1.0.\nWhich CodeIgniter version did you use?\n\nCheers,\nAndrey.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-09-27T07:48:46.893Z","updated_at":"2016-09-27T07:48:46.893Z","actor":{"username":"narf","cleared":false,"url":"/narf","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/038/733/d7e0c2e6fd2d983de427427f05ddae7189809a0b_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"codeigniter","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1218295,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @Narf,\n\nActually it affects the latest CI version running on servers with **PHP versions \u003c 5.4.0**, because newer PHP versions automatically decode the new HTML5 entities with the given flag.\nThe code snippet that does this rests at line 668 in ./system/core/Security.php\n```\n$flag = is_php('5.4')\n\t\t\t?
