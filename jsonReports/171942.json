Taking over the domain was enough to prove the existence of the vulnerability. If you wanted to take it a step further, you could have put up a page with \"test\" on it. Your approach however, was drastic and went against responsible disclosure guidelines. \n\nFrom the eligibility section of our [rules page](https://hackerone.com/snapchat), please note the following items:\n - Disclose the vulnerability report responsibly to us. Public disclosure or disclosure to other third parties - including vulnerability brokers - before we addressed your report forfeit the reward.\n - Demonstrate care in reproducing the vulnerability.\n\nWe understand from your earlier comments that you were not attempting to publicly disclose the issue; however, directly modifying our blog in production inherently caused a public disclosure resulting in us needing to take down the blog. Google search results for \"Snapchat blog\" showed your modifications as well, requiring us to rush to correct them.\n\nWhile you were professional and courteous in working with us to disclose this issue, and we definitely appreciate you writing in and working with us to resolve it, unfortunately our panel has decided, for the reasons above, that your report will not qualify for a bounty. For future reports, if you are unsure about how to create a proof of concept, please reach out to us so we can assist with the same.\n\nRegards,\nSubhash\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-10-05T02:37:28.712Z","updated_at":"2016-10-05T02:37:28.712Z","actor":{"username":"subhash","cleared":false,"url":"/subhash","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"jreynoldsdev","url":"/jreynoldsdev"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"snapchat","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1232616,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"While I accept your decision and appreciate your transparency I would like to clarify from my point of view.
