They fixed this issue few months back by adding a process that asks users whether user want to close all open sessions or not right after changing password.\r\n\r\nSo there is two way, either you let users to choose if they want to keep active sessions or just destroy every active sessions when users change his/her password!\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you!\r\n\r\nThanks and Best Wishes.","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-08-07T18:48:41.702Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-226522980.2256125,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":77514,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-23T06:40:23.948Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T06:40:23.948Z","actor":{"username":"prakharprasad","cleared":true,"url":"/prakharprasad","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/4Qcsaci6HdNLQCPM7oBdhJYY/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uzbey","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":80194,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Hello,\nThis issue is fixed now.
