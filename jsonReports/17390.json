Using this vulnerability I can read the client side source code of your website from a different origin (say prakharprasad.com) and then look for potentially sensitive data in those pages for example - CSRF prevention tokens and then successfully mount a side-wide CSRF attack (as I can read the token every time and on every page) or read messages. Once the victim views my page, I can read his `https://staging.uzbey.com/*` webpage source and then extract out the data I need (messages, anti-csrf tokens and what not).\r\n\r\n**Proof-of-Concept**:\r\n\r\n1. Login to your Uzbey account\r\n2. Visit https://demo.prakharprasad.com/uzbey/uzbey.html (and wait for 5 -10 seconds)\r\n3. Now visit https://staging.uzbey.com/messages and you'll see a message has been sent to *admin* saying *DemoHAX :)* \r\n\r\n**How this works?**\r\n\r\n1. My webpage loads an `\u003ciframe\u003e` pointing to https://demo.prakharprasad.com/uzbey/sniff.html\r\n2. `sniff.html` essentially embeds an SWF-file that has been uploaded to my (attacker's) photo gallery with **.jpg** extension - https://staging.uzbey.com/sites/default/files/magic.jpg \r\n3. Once the embedded file run, it sends a **GET** request to `https://staging.uzbey.com/messages/new`and passes the callback to a function called `nice()`within `sniff.html`. The callback data is the source code of the page that was requested with a **GET** earlier.\r\n4. Now`nice()`function parses the page for `form_bulid_id`and `form_token` and then builds up a form to mount the CSRF attack and then submits the form with a **POST** request. \r\n5. **Game over ! :)**\r\n\r\nBasically I used the upload functionality to upload the malicious SWF with **.jpg** extension and then loaded it in an iframe and did my work!\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\n@prakharprasad","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-08-22T12:35:16.496Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-225249422.53780648,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":78130,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Dude, Nice :)  So what is the fix for this ?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-23T22:07:30.404Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T22:07:30.404Z","actor":{"username":"mlitchfield","cleared":true,"url":"/mlitchfield","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/748/925210b2e90f4053a786099cc4294119a96157a9_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uzbey","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":78141,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Great find.
