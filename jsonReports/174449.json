We feel that there is a disconnect between what a hacker may want (especially if he/she left the program) vs. what a team was meaning, so we've reworded that setting to reflect that it only applies to hackers who are still invited to that private program. As this is just a UX issue, we consider this purely a functional bug.\n\nWhile looking into this issue, we noticed that banned hackers would also be receiving team messages sent via this feature. While still not a security issue (as the language does say \"All hackers\"), we do feel that it does warrant a hacker receiving information that a team may not wish to provide them. We've corrected the issue so that any banned hackers won't receive messages from those teams.\n\nThanks again for this report, and we look forward to future reports from you.\n\nHappy Halloween, and Happy Hacking!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-10-29T00:04:36.220Z","updated_at":"2016-10-29T00:04:36.220Z","actor":{"username":"reed","cleared":false,"url":"/reed","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/132/66d7eadcea16b878bb67bfd697b9542250a801a7_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"sasi2103","url":"/sasi2103"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1273730,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::NotEligibleForBounty","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-10-29T00:04:44.613Z","updated_at":"2016-10-29T00:04:44.613Z","actor":{"url":"/security","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/013/fa942b9b1cbf4faf37482bf68458e1195aab9c02_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"HackerOne"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1273735,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-10-29T00:07:41.680Z","updated_at":"2016-10-29T00:07:41.680Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"reed","cleared":false,"url":"/reed","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/132/66d7eadcea16b878bb67bfd697b9542250a801a7_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1309185,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-11-21T08:12:53.384Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T08:12:53.384Z","actor":{"username":"sasi2103","cleared":false,"url":"/sasi2103","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/426/eb6a5e545d2a2f2abe1f679c6e8622a92e42050f_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1309186,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-11-21T08:12:53.418Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T08:12:53.418Z","actor":{"username":"sasi2103","cleared":false,"url":"/sasi2103","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/426/eb6a5e545d2a2f2abe1f679c6e8622a92e42050f_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
