Valid email-id which is registered on hackerone.\r\n\r\nNow, chaining from my previously i.e lately reported bugs.\r\nUser enumeration attack I reported recently.\r\n\r\nOne can find a registered email easily. eg michiel@hackerone.com or jobert@hackerone.com\r\n\r\nBasic Idea :\r\n==========\r\n1. I am requesting a 'Reset Password link' to user's email. \r\neg.\r\nhttps://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\n2. Guessing the reset_password_token i.e reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\nAs everyone replying my bug reports know that there is no BRUTE FORCE protection. I am doing the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nProof of concept :\r\n================\r\n1. Generate a 'Reset Password link' of user whose account is to be compromised/hacked.\r\n2. Use a burp suite and configure it to do a Brute Force Attack on token\r\neg. https://hackerone.com/users/password/edit?reset_password_token=MUm2xQ_TEtf2RaG1H3DK\r\n\r\nNow, it is very easy to identify valid reset_password_tokens.\r\n\r\nServer Status 200 ---\u003e valid\r\nServer Status 302 ----\u003e invalid\r\n\r\nlength 4378 ---\u003evalid\r\nlength 1525 ---\u003einvalid\r\n\r\n3. Try resetting password now.\r\n4. Login with email and password.\r\n\r\nSpecial Note :\r\n===========\r\nAttacker doing a brute force will get all valid tokens which are requested by user and are valid.\r\nSo attacker can reset password of users.\r\n\r\nThis was all from me. Hope now you understand the severity and power of Brute Force.\r\nI am attaching a screenshot POC to show that there is no protection from server side as mentioned by @michiel and @jobert to me recently about brute force.\r\n\r\nJust I made attack on my account. To show it I am attaching a screen shot. \r\nAnd there is really no protection from hackerone server. I have already made few thousands request and I am eagerly waiting for something to block me from server side.\r\n\r\nHope you quickly get back to me. :)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nPranav","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-07-27T12:51:58.876Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-227494844.63937157,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":3,"voters":["powerjacobb1","dyabla","hackerlex"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":78855,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"POC","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-25T12:47:23.345Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T12:47:23.345Z","actor":{"username":"coolboss","cleared":true,"url":"/coolboss","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/GcQXHyfvnbR42mccVCF6Qk3s/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"attachments":[{"id":11919,"filename":"reset_token.png","type":"image/png","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/011/919/5337440daf7b22fcf935bdb502476ab58627dc3a/reset_token.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22reset_token.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27reset_token.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ4W3YS5FD%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T135243Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIGFHTfvNreCpBEx6ma8SNDd1vDDIfs0%2Bg65AmwngiTYQAiAlnCpBqU%2FBhidkHb7BIm1B5mCQRUOVIXp%2BQseSrlRN5iqDBAju%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMMkyyP6srRKwJnYw5KtcDHeBEJsk4F2SMjLLnKF6VZQ8gTH0LrxcCVqXSMNgZR1F18PpwhYbU8Qwfn4rOecOjc%2FGfNk3djcauIei8aKCcLnzshwHWQSvd29UhjSLaczWwVEte3ncX5%2F7TLBeg7zRQpsc0zFB20Cm8vF8Z5NfsChYhN7bulkH%2FDfJw16%2BYS1fZkQzhsF%2FUaEP8JAGkMj5v5WOr%2FLnx6%2FMMhK6%2BsDFWaIeUhAxulEbhuEZZ6dgcu1gqMyUwcg6D9rjwyKS9mTsUA%2BHVlKPil1lPtr7SxO3tf2vD8Cw7bLkyy75qgFHEvuDCUCELKpXfBVH6PD30xPvCzrVd0fptlqCTt6Cpd5I3iyyU9RW0SJyHzyBPACEpWDB8exeuJzM7TEeRFCbnl0%2FkfEHmTDCBuuqKxE7cVRG87tuNtO3iVLpOhHCzOtUoK2Il4kvMh2HPZMpvYIGHtynKBM%2BIh69sGJa0yvDoN%2FRI6PAGM02ZolRkS4bZfQfYm7fOPbpLxrQWbSljfYgc7qbAOT56FKw4Ty4wTdxJVV1NLklUpTvIFuc4wqfUdZCvpJj%2BZaH0CSm%2FQv7WX13ukuacZxFgzkAlzUArGS2%2FgJQFovV4hCQKUkAlBpn1fxDFCB%2FBfj2XYH0lMJ7wkIsGOqYBZLVkkm4v7ciHR6x1EZfGmDDAlA8GWCaRs%2B7p4f0zSrCh5MwJxKYAhCMitoCHTMbKlCWaIdMl5rpmPNjCa3GtIbMpvdZUwpN0EhEKHvK6WgKkHhzE8vZn5llsPReTP2V7t22qBXykSYg%2BgK2etoazMxx4eBGAB7YXcUmHU%2FW%2FCsmGlbwbgrQPl3suOkp4ARb2LIsd96p9ZA9i%2BG4DSDrVOakuIKwh2Q%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=c55a35d63e9a5259cb5f1bfb259dff916c7aa7590e6bd44cbda2c766e3aab9e4"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":78859,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Hi @pranav_hivarekar - is this quick enough? ;-) Thanks for your report.

I will do automated attack and spam your @jobert email-id with 25000 mails.\n\nThis is legal. \n\nThis was all I wanted to say.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-25T15:40:28.765Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T15:40:28.765Z","actor":{"username":"coolboss","cleared":true,"url":"/coolboss","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/GcQXHyfvnbR42mccVCF6Qk3s/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":78917,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @jobert\nI have now made 93000 requests.\nAre you notified?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-25T16:17:00.973Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T16:17:00.973Z","actor":{"username":"coolboss","cleared":true,"url":"/coolboss","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/GcQXHyfvnbR42mccVCF6Qk3s/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":79037,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Yes, but still with 93000 requests it is still a hopeless attempt that won't gain any satisfying results.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-25T19:04:34.988Z","updated_at":"2014-06-25T19:04:52.505Z","actor":{"username":"michiel","cleared":true,"url":"/michiel","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/007/439427fb81f710e5e16246ede1828613d46bb79e_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":79040,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Please try to look into the bugs that make real impact.

Yes, we should be as secure as possible, but the impact of a security vulnerability can vary based upon a combination of:\n\n- The type of user that's being targeted\n- The impact of the vulnerability\n\nThis can make it that we as HackerOne, decide not to fix certain reports that other companies might have fixed.\n \n\u003e As I can find a valid email-id which is registered on hackerone and request as many links I want.\n\u003e Here, user's email inbox will be spammed. \n\u003e You would not like to lose a User or A Team which is registered on hackerone due to spamming.\n\nI personally don't think that we will lose users, in case this ever happens. Our users know that we're a security oriented site, and although we really don't like to bother our users with stuff like this, I think that they will have enough understanding of the situation to not leave our site. Even more so because we would ban the spammer as soon as we'd detect an attack.\n\n\u003e I know you will now understand the severity of this bug. I want you to fix this bug on 'Reset Password Page'.\n\nWe still consider this bug a won't fix. I hope that I was able to convince you of our stance on this matter. I think that some of these low-priority bugs might get fixed in a more distant future, but for now we're focussing on getting the product even more awesome ;-). I hope you understand.\n\n\u003e I hope you will understand what I wanted to say this time.\n\nThanks for the excellent explanation! It really helped me understand the point that you're trying to make. Though I would like to ask you if you could file separate bugs for things like these. Your original report was called \"Account takeover\", but it turned into \"Ability to spam members of HackerOne\", which is a totally different report in my opinion. You maybe could've even replied on the already closed \"User Enumeration\" report.\n\nWe handle all reports with care, so there is no need to worry that we won't reply to you if you create another report for another bug!\n\nThanks again for the explanation, and thanks for the effort you put in helping us improve our security!\n\nRemon","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-28T18:18:23.334Z","updated_at":"2014-06-28T18:18:23.334Z","actor":{"username":"rso","cleared":false,"url":"/rso","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/031/bad304b45f09b089c121de18c65d91d226f0aeea_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":80886,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey ... @Remon\n\nI have been constantly following your site.
