This opens in a new tab, and the existing tab is *silently* redirected to my company website *without asking the user*. In a real life example, this would redirect to a phishing site to try gain credentials for users.\n\nThe javascript code that does all the magic: \n`window.opener.location.replace(newURL);`\n\nWays to solve this:\n\nDon't open links in new tabs using the target=\"_blank\"\nAdd attribute rel=\"noreferrer\" which also disables referrer\nSet the window.opener attribute to null on the new tab before redirecting, like this: \u003cscript\u003evar w=window.open(url, \"target=_blank\");w.opener=null;\u003c/script\u003e\nI hope you see why this is dangerous: this method has huge potential for tricking users that click on external links from this site to be a victim of a scam page because the redirecting is made in the background, while the user is focused on another tab.\n\nMore then that, some browsers like Mozilla for Android don't even display the URL, just the page title, so the user has no way of knowing that he was redirected to a scam page.\n\nNote that the target page doesn't have to be in the same-origin policy, so can be an entirely different domain, and the redirect happens silently while user is viewing another page.\n\nHope that all helps, let me know if you need more information. I can provide screenshots and/or screencasts if necessary.\n\nCheers,\n\nHugh","bounty_amount":"666.0","formatted_bounty":"$666","weakness":{"id":53,"name":"Open Redirect"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-12-28T01:41:56.573Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-151071128.1975868,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":30,"voters":["sameerphad72","man4bob","dmatrix","ankitsingh","mpz","madrobot","muhammad_uwais","eveeez","r3y","m16","and 20 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1279861,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for reporting this vulnerability to us.
