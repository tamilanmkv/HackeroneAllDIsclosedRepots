It turned out that there seems to be a lot of (probably) irrelevant javascript in the front-page redirector HTML with a number of odd strings and tricks commonly treated as indicators of compromise in html content.\n\nE.g. There is evaluation of multiple encrypted strings, SQL commands used by browser's websql database, ActiveX object references and a number of hidden form fields with suspicious autogenerated names triggered by obfuscated and encrypted javascript. All in a site that only serves a 301 Moved Permanently redirect within HTTP headers is bound to trigger a number of IDS heuristics and alert rules for apparently no good reason.\n\nI didn't look into the javascript very deeply, but it does not appear to load external content or perform anything actually malicious by itself. Most browsers probably won't even evaluate the content as they get immediately redirected to https://www.lahitapiola.fi/henkilo instead. Yet the content still gets transferred and can be seen by e.g. running `curl http://www.lahitapiola.fi/`. It's notable that if one loads the redirector through https, there's no content served. So I'm lead to believe this is probably a server configuration issue with some legacy tracking or anti-crawler code left somewhere along the index-page served by the http server at port 80. So it's likely nothing very serious and possibly even intentional for some reason.\n\nHowever, there could be some issues that arises from that thing lying in there. At least it will trigger anti-virus and IDS heuristics potentially causing your site to be unreachable for users behind strict security policies. If it is some kind of anti-crawler measure, it's kind of useless to be kept there as the crawlers will get redirected out from the script anyway to the other landing page without the scripts.","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-03-05T15:56:39.461Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-145231049.33643883,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":2,"voters":["eveeez","spetr0x"],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1281860,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us.
