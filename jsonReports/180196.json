In many cases, developers are trusting the HTTP Host header value and using it to generate links, import scripts and even generate password resets links with its value. This is a very bad idea, because the HTTP Host header can be controlled by an attacker. This can be exploited using web-cache poisoning and by abusing alternative channels like password reset emails.\n\n**POC**\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.google.com\n```\nResponse\n```\nHTTP/1.1 500 Domain Not Found\nServer: Varnish\nRetry-After: 0\ncontent-type: text/html\nCache-Control: private, no-cache\nconnection: keep-alive\nContent-Length: 207\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nDate: Mon, 31 Oct 2016 07:49:14 GMT\nVia: 1.1 varnish\nConnection: close\n\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n\u003ctitle\u003eFastly error: unknown domain www.google.com\u003c/title\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\nFastly error: unknown domain: www.google.com.
