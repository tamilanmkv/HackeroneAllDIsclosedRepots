Now that works. I'm getting a 422 status code.\n\nI am seeing three separate issues, all equally terrifying, which came together to cause the issue that we are facing.\n\n- The `authenticity_token` wasn't invalidated even though it was already used for deleting the first account.\n- The old session id wasn't invalidated by emptying the value of `_gitlab_session` cookie after the account was deleted.\n- Why was the **user submitted value** of `_gitlab_session` validated? That too, to a new account?\n\n I can easily leave a session id in a public system and wait for someone else to use that system to create a new account or login. Wouldn't this then validate the old session id (which I know) to someone's account? I mean, why was the old session id even allowed to be validated? Should I open this as a new issue?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-11-16T20:18:52.093Z","updated_at":"2016-11-16T20:19:24.767Z","actor":{"username":"7h0r4pp4n","cleared":false,"url":"/7h0r4pp4n","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/049/473/07654bfb1b6d3c864ae4308a340c28bff6a87ebe_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1303145,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"A couple of important things:\n\nThe old session ID used for authenticating the user is invalidated in the sense that it can no longer be used to authenticate. It's not being removed from the browser's cookie store but it is no longer trusted in any sense by GitLab. It can't be used for session fixation because session IDs are always replaced on a login attempt.\n\nNow why the old authentication token used to prevent CSRF is still honored is a good question and one I'm still trying to answer. It would be next to impossible to leverage this to attack a user because they would have to be logged into the very browsing session the attacker used to create their own session ID and auth token in the first place and then they'd have to be tricked into\nnavigating to a malicious site that leverages the CSRF attack.\n\nBtw, these CSRF authentication tokens are intended to be valid for the length of a session so the fact that they are still valid beyond a single form POST isn't an issue. Them being valid after a new session ID is assigned is concerning, however.\n\nI'll keep researching it and see if I can find the root cause. Feel free to do the same!
