Allow the first request which uploads this image to submit as normal.\n* Select the crop button, but do not allow the request to complete (I used Burp and enabled intercept mode). Modify the request to change the original_file parameter to point to a file you wish to delete, traversing up with ../.. if needed. So for example where my legitimate param was:\n\noriginal_file=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F~sam%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Favatars%2F2%2Fmy_ugly_face.jpg\n\nChange to:\n\noriginal_file=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2F~sam%2Fwordpress%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Favatars%2F2%2F../../../../../wp-config.php\n\nRemember it will be in a numbered folder probably, so you need one more .. than expected from the URL. You can upload an image for real to see how the path ends up for guidance on this if you're an attacker and don't know the folder structure.\n\nThe wp-config.php file will be deleted when unlink() is called and the blog will then be unavailable, of course, in this case.\n\nThis path needs to be somehow validated such that it can only delete uploaded avatars (constraining to the upload directory would still allow you to delete, say, other users avatars, or other uploaded files, which would still make me sad :()\n\nLet me know if you have any trouble reproducing or need any further info - I think I explained OK, but it is very late here. ;)\n\no/","bounty_amount":"350.0","formatted_bounty":"$350","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-09-21T07:33:08.539Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-127981344.19172224,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":8,"voters":["flamezzz","bogdantcaciuc","bl4de","cuso4","eveeez","japz","seafood","p3rs0n_0f_1nt3rn3t"],"severity":{"rating":"high","score":7.7,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"none","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1310676,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the report - we'll forward this issue to the BuddyPress team immediately.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-11-21T20:25:49.721Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T20:25:49.721Z","actor":{"username":"vortfu","cleared":false,"url":"/vortfu","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/982/1ef285fb263d30f189dc6a8038e1d5c46086e9d9_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpress","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1310816,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ExternalUserJoined","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-11-21T21:08:58.966Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T21:08:58.966Z","actor":{"username":"jjj","cleared":false,"url":"/jjj","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/007/063/b21324cc7d9861888c1ddd4fa345cda6612361ff_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpress","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1310859,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @mopman, thanks again for reporting this here.\n\nI'll be looking into this.
