as anyone can register `.com` sites to abuse it.\n\nThanks,\nPaulos","weakness":{"id":58,"name":"Command Injection - Generic"},"original_report_id":182557,"original_report_url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/182557","attachments":[{"id":140157,"file_name":"win7poc.JPG","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/140/157/e4d1acd505d3f86d1b5700a5191a76af095b9529/win7poc.JPG?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22win7poc.JPG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27win7poc.JPG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQY5I5ZOTN%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T135648Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQCqf43kV8RTzzmWR1TXeEdpx%2Fd5zGOFNpfZDgSM2xJuCQIhAMLYAxjZR7PGO9btJ9wGFbOqf%2FTbE2pC%2FdkQgyPDWZD8KoMECO7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgzmKazqBIClFAMqc2Iq1wNPV39BSW59qP%2ByHsmBjxY6m%2Fb7a6U5448PKOSe8dVf6ZB9c%2BLac%2F0Gz8ADXdDYKsvWZv%2FAmBj5%2FhHzWjVphb45t9jx%2BhpJI0AITzRmRN5aq7TLFOZDfehY6xr7qR34eKZAu9XJrbi4QdAu%2BNSUgERhmM4muMj19K4msZk8sFVbAKLF%2BU6gGnywSDktUJmbSxfnY6ZesCS5elWm1qPvYsKCbrl5y57ovXEaa7NAn6XfLDrVTRtpY8qRzPQbURfe%2FnNfBCEGQCwCuB8zQszv%2B2O4z6L6fFCLSm2gccXmLLJqlgBN7EwqRjH0XLKpn1vWKBfmNtQJMcfcBOgesSBjohFRDqs9VtzSm8Ar%2FZ3tQRyj3E5FFBVh7SFXfbH0zIPhcJnR7J%2Ft20n0T0BoFfeC4Lh04EDdGi1xF35UayBRbz0euxaVcKV0UA%2BktOyHmbRzgaonWDeZCOaJtjFZCGnWooRLI6KrYUmAIMrnyQoKS2q8DQKxvweDK7%2FuWfo1ovNRy%2BMy3v8N%2B%2B6q1M2DXNkYeXZoalrKF%2BzGC2C%2FRVd1z2LoHJiVHopIG7T4Lyax%2BX9LY1Z9oVqxPxTo9SgiI1kD69%2Bl5MKWzogETScQuH%2Bvi36SPh1QbdmYvwgw5O6QiwY6pAEabkl2EyHSmga%2FQVBclzYljmd0Pvwag9ITi%2BNlOViZyzeqV8k%2F8Q8ny0OOVtCp3iCSdWDf1LHd%2BqKtTjKS7CIODHKRsg4m3sx7QNZBHT5H00n5U2ZVgN4N9m3YxiNqVHw1I0Jv0KF1%2BS2XFhkFHuxBokXIzihowuz57pmo5yGw3bX16HVqCrlEZdpJDLSrVWPAr55aHcggcNaCjNyYlZGc9VtWCw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=70c2e61c87df0fc981709e06c11a63914a82218619a404a46d01c96854e63958","file_size":71016,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":8,"voters":["mdv","madrobot","supernatural","khizer47","shinkurt","paulos_","sa1tama0","costis"],"severity":{"rating":"high","score":8.8,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1339067,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"little correction on the recommended fix: other sites don't add `.html/htm` on to the page domain.
