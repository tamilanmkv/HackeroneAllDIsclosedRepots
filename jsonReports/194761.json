Given this scenario, it may not be able to keep on upgrading openssl (most of the time upgrading openssl requires OS/server restart) for every release, therefore, the correct approach is to  reduce the attack surface. \nAnd couple of reasons:\n* The preferred cipher suites listed above is well tested for security,speed,order of preference.\n* The above list is the minimal list of cipher suites that supports all modern/old browser(exception IE on XP)\n* The list above only has strong cipher suites in order of preference(essentially with the list above you are saying internet that you only support strong cipher suites and force clients to establish handshake on preferred list).\n* The cipher suites list above supports perfect forward secrecy for all modern browsers.\n\n**Most importantly, speed:**\nAs you business model demands end users to share PII data on your infrastructure, besides security, speed has to be another important factor into consideration. You could very well see the difference on speed of SSL handshake between client and your infrastructure with the command below:\n\n```\nfor x in {1..10}; do curl -kso /dev/null -w \"tcp:%{time_connect}, ssldone:%{time_appconnect}\\n\" https://viestinta.lahitapiola.fi; done\n```\n\nRun the above bash command before and after updating cipher suites to find out the speed of SSL handshake.\n\n**__PS: The cipher suite list not only applies for viestinta.lahitapiola.fi but for all your business critical infrastructure.__**\n\nRegards\nAkshya","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":32,"name":"Cryptographic Issues - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-02-18T11:50:14.504Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-146542120.9707937,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":2,"voters":["eveeez","spetr0x"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":4.8,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1391889,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us.

Noteworthy for this report is that at the time we reconfigured our SSL/TLS, we had already received a few other reports on the same issue.
