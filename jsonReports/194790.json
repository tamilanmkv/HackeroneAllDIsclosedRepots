Somehing really bad is happening here. I finally managed to find something after almost 2 hours of trying to replicate this with controlled input. This is a cross account vulnerability. For info, the account that shared the task is : user2@sandbox-1\n\n1.  The POC that leaks only the attachement names is cross accounts ! The file damndaniel.exe is an attachement for a task that belongs to user1@sandbox-1\n2. The download vulnerability works __cross accounts__ regardless whether they are shared or not ! Example I found :\nThe id 2 contains the file \"Capture.PNG\" that actually is a file from another account, user1@sandbox-1. This file is located in My files / Music / Capture.PNG. __This folder is not shared__, it does not appear in the shared folder. The contents of this image are identical with the one downloaded by calling that download link with id 2.\n\nAlso, I have seen the image with ID 145 somewhere else but I cannot find it again unfortunatelly. I know this because I tought : \"Wow, someone actually put this very nice image with the mountains in the sandbox account\"\n\nThe ids also range from 2 to 145, witch is a very big gap that cannot contain only the files from one sandbox account. Not all work, but still many do.\n\nI will try to find something more, but this weekend I won't be at home. Is this enough for now for you ?\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-12-30T12:57:00.317Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T12:57:00.317Z","actor":{"username":"inhibitor181","cleared":true,"url":"/inhibitor181","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/iK9ytFYT28QM6G5xrCaphqnv/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"open-xchange","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1392179,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Additions :\n- The file damdaniel.exe, witch belongs to user1 is a task item and is available for download with id 34 -\u003e so again, cross accounts download\n- Not that many files see, to bo accesible (about 30-40% between the ids 2-145) so that means that there is a special case there.
