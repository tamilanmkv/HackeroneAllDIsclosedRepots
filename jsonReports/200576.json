Admin creates a New Relic account, invites User1 as a restricted user to join the team\n2. User2 joins the team, then clicks on \"Infrastructure\" tab\n3. User2 clicks on \"Start my 30 day free trial\", then they are directed to this url: https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/install\n4.
