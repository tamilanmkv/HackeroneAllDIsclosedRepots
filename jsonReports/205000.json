But code activation on the `https://p.grabtaxi.com/api/passenger/v2/profiles/activate` has 3 attempts limit, then it will be expired.\nCombined this two facts, i found that it is possible to succeed in the account takeover of any user using only phone number.\nMethod: we have only 3 code attempts, and we can reset the code every 30 seconds without rate limiting.\n**This gave us 6 attempts in the minute, 360 attempts in the hour, and 8640 attempts in 24 hour**. Since codes range has only 9999 values (it is 4-digit), we will likely succeed with the correct code in the 24-72 hours.\nAttacker just need to choose some 3 custom OTP codes, for example, 1056, 1057, 1058, and start trying to send them every 30 seconds. If all 3 codes will fail - reset it and try again in next 30 seconds. Sooner or later, Grab Server will throw some of this codes, and this code will be accepted, and we will have access to the victim's account. How it looks in the Web Debugger - you can see on the screenshot attached (`test.png`).\nExample report, where used similar method: https://hackerone.com/reports/149598\n\n##Impact\n\nThe attacker can bypass OTP verification on Grab android app on any mobile number using \"Login with mobile number\" option. Attacker can succeed in the account takeover of any user without any privileges, using only phone number and country code.\n\n##Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Use my POC tool, attached to the report (written on C#, requires .NET 4.0). Sources included.\n2. Enter your test phone number  to the field (it must starts with country code without `+` and be the connected to the Grab account on Android app) - or you can use my test number `███` and press Start.\n3. Tool will start sending 3 code attempts `1056, 1057, 1058` and refreshing the code in case of failing every 30 seconds. The process may take many hours, but sooner or later you will receive message with success response and session header. \n\n\n##Mitigation/Remediation Steps:\nI suggest you implement a rate-limiting on this endpoint `https://p.grabtaxi.com/api/passenger/v2/profiles/activationsms`, for example, blocking code resending for some time after 5 or more resends.\n\n\n\n","bounty_amount":"1000.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,000","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication -

It is a pleasure to work with you!\n\n###Technique\nThe used method (thanks to the @yaworsk and his #149598 report!) is highly depending on the luck due to low enough chance to guess correct code using only 3 attempts in 30 seconds (and we must consider that the server may not throw the one of the choosen codes for a very long time). So account takeover is not so easy, and requires a lot of time. The side effect of this - it is abusing the SMS sending mechanism (it was fixed too).\n\n###Why it works\n1) The code had only 4 digits (with 5-6 digits chance to guess the code dramatically drop). Even with 4 digits tool can work a week without results.\n*and*\n2) There was no limiting on the code refreshing attempts  (now it is, and also account can be locked).\n\n###Used tools and apps:\n1) Nox App Player (android emulator), proxied through web debugging proxy.\n2) Tested application - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grabtaxi.passenger (app allows registration from any country)\n3) Custom C# tool for SMS code refreshing.","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false,"attachments":[],"user":{"id":79690,"username":"sp1d3rs","name":"Dr. Jones","bio":"Human.
