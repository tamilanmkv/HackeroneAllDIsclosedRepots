Furthermore, it is also used for port scan by Cross-Site Port Attack (XSPA).\n\nFor example, I could identify several services running on this server.\n\n* FTP (port 20) and SSH (port 22) are running\n    Request: `GET http://█████████:20/ HTTP/1.1`\n    Response: `HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable`\n\n    Request: `GET http://██████████:21/ HTTP/1.1`\n    Response: `Timeout`\n\n    Request: `GET http://███:22/ HTTP/1.1`\n    Response: `HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable`\n\n* LDAP (port 389) is running\n    Request: `GET http://█████████:387/ HTTP/1.1`\n    Response: `Timeout`\n\n    Request: `GET http://█████:389/ HTTP/1.1`\n    Response: `HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable`\n\n* MSSQL (port 1433) is running\n    Request: `GET http://████████:1431/ HTTP/1.1`\n    Response: `Timeout`\n\n    Request: `GET http://█████:1433/ HTTP/1.1`\n    Response: `HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable`\n\n## Suggested Remediation Actions\nI assume that this behavior is caused not by the web server, but by the system located in front of it (e.g. cache server). In that system, if there is no Host header in the HTTP request (e.g. HTTP/0.9 support) it may be referring to an absolute-URI.\n\nIt is suggested that you change the setting of the cause system so that it does not refer to the absolute-URI of the HTTP request with no Host header.\n\n\u003eThis white paper may help you identify the cause.\n\u003ehttp://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf","weakness":{"id":68,"name":"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":7,"voters":["realtess","eveeez","domssilva","0xdf53c","itsping","kathirkutty","onanana"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1493648,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
