Send a test mail to `█████████` which is private and have email forwarding setup.\n2. Click and follow the link on the email response and you become auto invited to the program (intentional).\n3. __NO NOT__ submit the test report (__means the email link already used, but you did not continue to submit the report, you are now participants to the program__).\n4. Now Quit to the program.\n5. Go to email and click the same link and you can get back without requesting another link (using submit report via email forwarding)\n\n__Link on the email response of forwarding feature should expire after first use__\n{F164319}\n\n### Impact:\n\nWhen the user quits, or if the program owner dicided to remove/banned the user on participating private program, the user should not get back unless the program owners decide to un-banned and the user/researcher gets invited again. \n\n### Mitigation:\n\nThe email forwarding feature should expire after it's first use, do not allow the attacker to reused the link to join to the program.\n\nPlease ask if you need more information.\n\nRegards\nJapz\n","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-06-12T19:23:47.287Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-105129586.59620826,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":36,"voters":["jokebookservice1","sameerphad72","emitrani","thehackerish","asad0x01_","taaminz","eveeez","r3y","haxta4ok00","an0nym0us","and 26 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1506643,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\u003eNO NOT submit the test report (means the email link already used, but you did not continue to submit the report, you are now participants to the program).\n\nStep 3 typo correction on my reproduction steps: That is __DO NOT__ , not NO NOT :)\n\n__Additional information on the bug:__\n\nPlease note that this will work when the `Submit Vulnerability Report` button already clicked but the user __DID NOT hit the Submit Report button inside the program submission page.__ (means did not continue submitting the report, but already joined on the program because already clicked the `Submit Vulnerability Report` on the screenshot below:\n\n{F164320}\n\nAs you can see on the PoC screenshot above, when that `Submit Vulnerability Report` was clicked, the user/researcher already auto invited to the program (private or not) , but when the user already quit, the user can __reuse__ that button/link to join again.\n\nRegards\nJapz","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-02-26T17:13:46.134Z","updated_at":"2017-02-26T17:21:00.605Z","actor":{"username":"japz","cleared":false,"url":"/japz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/078/347/38b576ad263c5255e136ebbd3a19eb61ff7a298d_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1506925,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"While this isn't ideal behavior, it is not a security vulnerability.
