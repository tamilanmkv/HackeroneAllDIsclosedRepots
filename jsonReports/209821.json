Just wanted to forward you @zseano's message.\n\n\u003eHi there,\n\u003e\n\u003eSorry for the confusion on BugBountyNotes with regards to the report. We scrape data from HackerOne on a regular basis and it was highlighted to us that we were marking reports as 'Resolved' when in reality some had been closed as Informative. We have made changes to our platform to reflect this and will work to fix the error on any other reports. \n\u003e\n\u003eWe recommend to always go by your report on HackerOne for final details about a report as we are merely just a third party platform.\n\u003e\n\u003eThanks,\n\u003eSean (zseano)\n\nHope that clears up any confusion.\n\n\\- Ed","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-09-05T11:09:46.494Z","updated_at":"2019-09-05T11:09:46.494Z","actor":{"username":"edoverflow","cleared":true,"url":"/edoverflow","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/116/374/9a3cf4d62b2f507a0d33808aacbad863ec4455ac_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5737474,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @edoverflow,\n\nVery kind of you to forward this.
