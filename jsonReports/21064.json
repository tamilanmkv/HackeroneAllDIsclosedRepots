In general, if an attacker has access to a browser process with information in history, they can attack it directly. #13587 discusses an attack where the attacker simply inspects the process memory to retrieve the password.\n\nSimilarly, attackers with access to the process can just install a keylogger before you use the machine.\n\nUsing untrusted machines is inherently dangerous, and there are severe limits to the steps we can realistically take to protect users. We also already support two-factor auth, which is probably the best general-purpose mitigation against this class of attacks.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-07-22T18:35:51.304Z","updated_at":"2014-07-22T18:35:51.304Z","actor":{"username":"epriestley","cleared":false,"url":"/epriestley","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/043/3ebca5250ea5abd54b49ccc9d69c636af4585b2e_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"phabricator","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":93661,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Well the vulnerability which you are describing regarding - obtaining user creds from memory is different attack which is used for forensics altogether.\n\nThe vulnerability exists on registration page hence 2F auth is of no use here.\n\nThis attack can be used POST the user has created an account.
