Luckily for us, the framework we use (Meteor), while it relies heavily on web sockets, seems to be immune to this type of attack because it uses on localStorage for authentication rather than cookie-based auth, or other fairly vulnerable methods. By design, the sensitive information in localStorage is only accessible by javascript from the same origin.\n\nWhile it is possible to replay an upgrade request from another origin, the process you describe would require an attacker to compromise a user's browser to access the digest in order to be authenticated. If the browser itself is compromised, that's not really something we could protect against.\n\nHere is some more detail on the security implications of CSWSH-type attacks in Meteor: http://www.east5th.co/blog/2015/06/08/authentication-with-localstorage/\n\nNow, if there was some way to establish an authenticated web socket connection from another origin, that would be A Very Bad Dayâ„¢ for us, and for every other site that uses the Meteor framework. It's one reason we're so sensitive to respond to script injection attacks since some of those could potentially expose localStorage. Perhaps that is a potential attack vector for you to attempt: if you can somehow inject a script and expose the token in localStorage, then use that to execute arbitrary code on a malicious server. So, I'm going to close out this issue and we can reopen it if an attack like that can be demonstrated.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-03-07T16:55:31.379Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T16:55:31.379Z","actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1957534,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-26T23:09:59.510Z","updated_at":"2017-08-26T23:09:59.510Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2068278,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-10-16T07:07:08.334Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T07:07:08.334Z","actor":{"username":"aishu_kc","cleared":false,"url":"/aishu_kc","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2068279,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-10-16T07:07:08.370Z","updated_at":"2017-10-16T07:07:08.370Z","actor":{"username":"aishu_kc","cleared":false,"url":"/aishu_kc","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
