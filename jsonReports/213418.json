It does not really matter if the person misusing credentials get caught or not, the customer data is already lost and it can not be recovered or made private by any means. Let´s assume that your family members all personal information and medical history related to Localtapiola will be in PasteBin. Even if the person responsible is jailed, your family members personal and private information is openly available and we can only imagine the cost in the 30 years to come when everything is taken in to account e.g. when calculating your personal insurance policies or applying into job. The data is lost, is public and misusable forever. In my thoughts TUPAS-creds are not the \"thing\" here and you are right that if person have another TUPAs-creds, there will be very interesting targets too.\n\nHaving been watching the handling of personal data in \"KANTA\" or other in medical information systems(e.g. PEGASOS, APOTTI), access to even light personal data is heavily restricted and regulated. (It would be unheard of that a total outsider could see the data or medical records of any number of persons.) One might think it should (and is?) be as restricted in the insurance and insurance claim handling. You have the number of how many of your clients have enabled \"pääkäyttäjä\". I would estimate that we can get quite an amount of \"free accounts\" stolen with little programming and then could exploit all data retrievable in the accounts.  Maybe results could be data from some tens of thousands smaller companies and thousands to some tens of thousands personal data records including medical information?\n\nAs for b) someone stealing TUPAS-creds is another story is beside my point.\n\nI am glad to continue this conversation if need be.\n\n//","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-05-28T20:15:12.503Z","updated_at":"2017-05-28T20:15:12.503Z","actor":{"username":"billy_blaze","cleared":false,"url":"/billy_blaze","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"localtapiola","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1940572,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi Thomas,\n\nHave you yet discussed this more at the advisory board?\n\n//","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-19T07:49:13.049Z","updated_at":"2017-08-19T07:49:13.049Z","actor":{"username":"billy_blaze","cleared":false,"url":"/billy_blaze","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"localtapiola","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1940587,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugReopened","message":"No we have not.

Initially this report was dismissed based on the existing risk assessment. The reporter however showed exemplary persistence and did a very thorough rebuttal of the bug bounty team's conclusions and decisions. The issue was then escalated within LähiTapiola with the specific angle of privacy and potential information leak of privacy sensitive data.
