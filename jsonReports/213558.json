Generating a backup creates a tar file consisting of the database as a SQL file and uploaded files from /public/upload/*. Having the ability to upload these tar files and restore from them, you can add any file that you wish. \n\nManually modifying the tar archive and adding a symlink, you are able to read any arbitrary file that the user has permission to including files outside of the Discourse application directory.\n\n## Steps\n\n1. Load http://try.discourse.org\n2. Login as an Admin user.\n3. Go to the Backups page:\n * http://try.discourse.org/admin/backups/\n4. Create a new backup including files.\n5. Extract the backup files to a folder on your server.\n6. Create a symlink to `/etc/passwd` In the /uploads/ folder of the backup, e.g. `/uploads/default/original/1X/[file].jpg`.\n * example: `ln -s /etc/passwd /home/symlink/files/uploads/default/original/1X/7ad2e8f5fe02890f20503044b604e29e6f3718fd.png`\n7. Create a .tar.gz from the extracted files.\n8. Upload the newly crafted tar to the server.\n9. Enable `Restore from Backups` in settings if it's not enabled.\n10. Restore from the backup that uploaded.\n11. Go to the uploaded file in your browser after it uploads, e.g.\n * http://try.discourse.org/uploads/default/original/1X/[file].jpg\n12. ---\u003e You were able to read file contents of `/etc/passwd`
