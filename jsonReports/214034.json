That's why we don't normally include security patches in major releases like 9.0. Security releases always contain backports so users don't have to upgrade to the latest major version.\n\nWe did have a critical security release last Monday as well. Unfortunately a patch was not ready for your report by then as we had only just received it before that weekend. A patch for this should be in our next security release.
