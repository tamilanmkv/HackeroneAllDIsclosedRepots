This attack, called POODLE, is similar to the BEAST attack and also allows a network attacker to extract the plaintext of targeted parts of an SSL connection, usually cookie data. Unlike the BEAST attack, it doesn't require such extensive control of the format of the plaintext and thus is more practical.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability\n\tAn attacker may be able to exploit this problem to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and decrypt communications between the affected service and clients.\n\nPoC:\n$ nmap  -sV --version-light --script ssl-poodle -p 443 cloud.newrelic.com\nPORT    STATE SERVICE REASON\n443/tcp open  https   syn-ack\n| ssl-poodle:\n|   VULNERABLE:\n|   SSL POODLE information leak\n\n$ nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p 443 cloud.newrelic.com\n\nPORT    STATE SERVICE\n443/tcp open  https\n| ssl-enum-ciphers:\n|   SSLv3:\n|     ciphers:\n|       TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (rsa 2048) - A\n|       TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA (rsa 2048) - A\n|       TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (rsa 2048) - C\n|     compressors:\n|       NULL\n|     cipher preference: server\n|     warnings:\n|       64-bit block cipher 3DES vulnerable to SWEET32 attack\n|       CBC-mode cipher in SSLv3 (CVE-2014-3566)\n\nHow to fix this vulnerability\n\tIt's recommended to disable SSLv3 and replace it with TLSv1.0 as soon as compatibility with legacy clients is no longer required.
