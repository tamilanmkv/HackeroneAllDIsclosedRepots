I was able to create an `attack.com` namespace which translates to `https://attack.com/repo/`.\nThe app will then send a request including the anti-CSRF token to an attacker controlled domain. Which it definitely should not, ever (see point 2. below).\n\n# Impact\n\nA malicious web page and the coordinated server will be able to perform actions through the victim's browser in a second.\n\nIn addition, this opens up a new attack surface as the app will process untrusted replies as trusted content. There is high risk of injecting javascript somewhere, maybe here:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/f78ecda55d5431f9a74ab2892b516ecb45f24d80/app/assets/javascripts/environments/components/environment_terminal_button.js#L33\n\n# Recommendations\n\nIssues of this kind should be fixed globally, since the code is recent and developers are likely to introduce more `document.location` dependencies regularly.\n\n1. Validate or normalize requested URLs against //, /../, and co. This can be done in Rails or in JS, or both.\n\n2. Forbid cross-domain requests in all `Vue.http` and `$.ajax` helpers, like this one:\nhttps://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/blob/f78ecda55d5431f9a74ab2892b516ecb45f24d80/app/assets/javascripts/vue_shared/vue_resource_interceptor.js#L21\n\nBest regards,\nAurel","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-10-09T12:14:37.331Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-126409947.25638169,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["eveeez","cr4xerbik4sh","secdoor","cryptphi"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":6.3,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"high","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1615461,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi @naure,\n\nThanks for the report!
