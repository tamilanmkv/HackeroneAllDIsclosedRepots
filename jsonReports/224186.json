Anybody may send email from weblate.org (or subdomain), that are not protected (because SPF does not mean, that email service will do something with spoofed email (for example, Yahoo will add it to inbox)). \n\nYou may use https://emkei.cz/ to test this bug. For example, I sent email from admin@weblate.org (or test@mail.weblate.org) to my email and got this message.\n\nWhy it is dangerous?\n\nAttacker may send fake email from your domain and ask user to do somethig. For example, go to site and insert password. User may trust, because email send from normal domain.\n\nIf you try send email from Facebook main site, Google domain, you will not get message.
