I like that you're chaining the vulnerability with an XSS to store the vulnerability information. However, as you perfectly understand, with the XSS you could create any task. Because this might be exploited when you know a colleague of yours (someone that has access to the same JIRA instance), we'll move to a `POST` request for the `/reports/:id/escalate` endpoint. I haven't looked at how much effort this will take, so I can't give you an ETA on a fix yet. This obviously doesn't solve for the XSS vulnerability in JIRA, but breaks the chain to get access to report content that you might not be authorized to see.
