This also allows an attacker to **update** or **edit** the Push Server in the ██████████ CMS.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n1.

Now visit `https://████████/█████/filepush/ftp/303/` \n\nYou will be able to see my ftp server details and you will be able to update or delete it!\n\nAn attacker can bruteforce the id to see if the server gives back a valid response.
