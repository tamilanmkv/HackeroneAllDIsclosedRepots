The solution can be implemented even if password is hashed. The hashes of last '3-4' number of password should be stored and every time user tries to change the password, the hash of new password should be checked again hash of old passwords. The new password should only be allowed to set if it's hash does not match old password's hash.\n\nYes, and its up to the user to choose his password but user would definitely use his new password from one of his old password, if allowed to do so.\n\nAdditional Info:\nIn the research paper you provided, the user would change the new password something similar to his old password, if the exact similar old password is not allowed to used. The solution for this is available too. The old password should be first mutated before hashing it and the hash of mutated password should be created. Every time user tries to change password, the hash of new password should be matched against hashes of old password and mutated password.\n\nRegards,\nAbiral","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-05-19T02:53:12.911Z","updated_at":"2017-05-19T02:53:12.911Z","actor":{"username":"proabiral","cleared":true,"url":"/proabiral","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/SgUoabqs214KtgPXuTbModLh/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"weblate","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1685352,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Still I fail to see why we should avoid this.
