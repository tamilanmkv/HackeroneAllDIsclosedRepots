To use such algorithms, the data is broken into fixed-length chunks, called blocks, and each block is encrypted separately according to a mode of operation.

We aim to respond to your report as soon as possible, but due to the complexity of the systems, triaging many times can take a long time. We prioritize issues -  reports containing trivial issues with limited (or no) business impact and badly written reports with insufficient information on how to reproduce the issue receive a lower priority. Please do not request updates for at least 20 days into the process. Once triaged and verified, bounty decisions are made 1-2 times per month.\n\n*Note: if we frequently dismiss your reports, make sure you have read our policy and stay in scope and that you know how to write good reports - https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/articles/211538803-Step-by-Step-How-to-write-a-good-vulnerability-report*","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-05-27T20:09:15.342Z","updated_at":"2017-05-27T20:09:15.342Z","actor":{"username":"localtapiola-thomas","cleared":false,"url":"/localtapiola-thomas","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/060/017/8cccb6dc22038468aec723dab1945e7df637da6b_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"localtapiola","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1705480,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Okay, Thanks","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-05-27T20:17:38.324Z","updated_at":"2017-05-27T20:17:38.324Z","actor":{"username":"t0ns","cleared":false,"url":"/t0ns","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/037/217/68b78f00f3240c9a725f260c0f80a3340fcae9a8_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"localtapiola","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1778443,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"This is now verified.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-06-24T07:36:40.392Z","updated_at":"2017-06-24T07:36:40.392Z","actor":{"username":"localtapiola-thomas","cleared":false,"url":"/localtapiola-thomas","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/060/017/8cccb6dc22038468aec723dab1945e7df637da6b_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"localtapiola","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1778456,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"Based on the fact that SSL-issues are really out of scope (for a reason), and the fact that sweet32 is not regarded as such a huge issue (the exploitability is not really easy), we have decided on a small award.
