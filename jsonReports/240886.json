'/';`\n\nto fight File inclusion attacks by filtering out .. so ../../../other/directories attacks won't happen. however there is a bypass for this, while pocking around, I noticed .%00.../.%00.../path works the same as ../../path because of the nullbyte in the middle. to test if your patch can stop this, lets try:\n```php\n$page = str_replace('..', '', preg_replace('/[ \u003c\u003e\\'\\\"\\r\\n\\t\\(\\)]/', '', $_GET['deletepage'])) . '/';\nunlink($page);\n```\n\nBy sending .%00.../.%00.../path.file -- an attacker can delete file in my example.\n\nNow this vulnerability is all over the code and by looks of it, affects all kinds of versions including the latest one.\n\nIn `/wp-cache.php`:\n```php\n1575: $page = str_replace('..', '', preg_replace('/[ \u003c\u003e\\'\\\"\\r\\n\\t\\(\\)]/', '', $_POST['deletepage'])) . '/'; \n1576: $pagefile = realpath(ABSPATH . $page . 'index.html'); \n1584: unlink unlink($pagefile); \n```\n\nor \n```php\n1576: $pagefile = realpath(ABSPATH . $page . 'index.html'); \n1575: $page = str_replace('..', '', preg_replace('/[ \u003c\u003e\\'\\\"\\r\\n\\t\\(\\)]/', '', $_POST['deletepage'])) . '/';\n1585: unlink unlink($pagefile . '.gz'); \n```\n\nor in `/wp-cache-phase1.php`:\n\nwhere `$requset_uri` is defined as:\n```php\n15: $request_uri = str_replace('..', '', preg_replace('/[ \u003c\u003e\\'\\\"\\r\\n\\t\\(\\)]/', '', $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'])); \n```\n\nand used multiple times all over the code. \n\nAnd in /advanced-cache.php to unlink file, to delete, read, rename, opendir and in multiple places all over the code base.\n\nI believe instead of reporting each, reporting why the mitigation is bypassable is so much more easier.\n\n### Recommended Fix:\n\nTo include nullbytes in the str_replace check.\n\n\nThanks,\nPaulos","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-10-29T12:20:01.633Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-93145912.63016656,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":14,"voters":["jensec","ali","eveeez","an0nym0us","khizer47","paulos_","cryptographer","reppie","ksokd9j29jsnoe","the0","and 4 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1762703,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks Paulos,\n\nWe'll look into this.\n\nDonncha","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-06-17T05:45:24.201Z","updated_at":"2017-06-17T05:45:24.201Z","actor":{"username":"donncha","cleared":false,"url":"/donncha","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"automattic","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":true},{"id":1765067,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Have you been able to exploit this on a test site to delete any file you want?\n\nPlaces where files are deleted are protected by a nonce, and paths have \"index.html\" or some sort of \"Index-*\" filename attached to them before deleting, so the only files an attacker could delete would be html files, if they could get past the nonce.\n\nIn Github master we've added extra checks to several of the file related functions.
