Returns true if it is,\n    false if it either failed to validate or has expired.\n    A token is a combination of a unix timestamp and a signature\"\"\"\n    t = token[:15]\n    signature = token[15:]\n    expected_signature = hmac.new(key, msg=t, digestmod=hashlib.sha1).hexdigest()\n    return signature == expected_signature and int(t) \u003e= int(time.time())\n~~~\n\nThe `==` operation does a byte-by-byte comparison of two values and as soon as the two differentiate it terminates. This means the longer it takes until the operation returns, the more correct characters the attacker has guessed. An attacker can then create a valid HMAC without knowing the HMAC key.\n\n# How can this be fixed?\n---\n\nYou have already imported the hmac module, so this fix simply consists of changing one line.\n\n~~~diff\ndef verify_access_token(token, key):\n    \"\"\"Verify that the given access token is still valid.
