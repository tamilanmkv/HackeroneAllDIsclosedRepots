Create a webhook at https://app.mixmax.com/dashboard/settings/rules with url `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`.\n2. Trigger this webhook by sending/receiving an email. Wait a few hours.\n3. Note that an email is not sent saying the webhook failed. I tried for other internal urls such as 'http://localhost', but they sent a failure email, indicating that `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` is open to the webhook.\n4. In addition to verifying that this endpoint exists, an attacker could enumerate endpoints on this domain. For example, an attacker could enumerate MAC addresses at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/network/interfaces/macs/xx:xx:...`.\n\nSuggested fix:\n\nBlacklist the AWS metadata url and any other sensitive internal urls.\n\nThanks.","weakness":{"id":68,"name":"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-08-17T18:11:02.189Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-130969053.90885939,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":14,"voters":["sp1d3rs","cablej","yumi","eveeez","r3y","christophetd","ifrahiman","m16","ronygigi","zerotoone","and 4 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1784254,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks, will fix!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-06-27T13:00:31.325Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T13:00:31.325Z","actor":{"username":"tr3y","cleared":false,"url":"/tr3y","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mixmax","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1812505,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"This should now be fixed!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-07-06T20:20:50.718Z","updated_at":"2017-07-06T20:20:50.718Z","actor":{"username":"tr3y","cleared":false,"url":"/tr3y","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mixmax","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1842565,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-07-17T11:10:02.120Z","updated_at":"2017-07-17T11:10:02.120Z","actor":{"username":"tr3y","cleared":false,"url":"/tr3y","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"reporter":{"username":"cablej","url":"/cablej"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mixmax","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1847445,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Great, would you like to disclose?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-07-18T18:11:02.140Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T18:11:02.140Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"cablej","cleared":true,"url":"/cablej","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/042/859/7fdafea90092a305ae2cb6cec7d43461783abf0c_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mixmax","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1847514,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-07-18T18:20:49.628Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T18:20:49.628Z","actor":{"username":"wearhere","cleared":false,"url":"/wearhere","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mixmax","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1847515,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-07-18T18:20:49.676Z","updated_at":"2017-07-18T18:20:49.676Z","actor":{"username":"wearhere","cleared":false,"url":"/wearhere","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mixmax","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2864935,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::NotEligibleForBounty","message":"We took a pause on HackerOne for a while and have made substantial changes to our platform since then.
