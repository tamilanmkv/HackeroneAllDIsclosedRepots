That is correct, we arbitrarily chose versions \u003e6 months old and redirect users of those browsers to browser-update.org. The main reason we did this is that we did a big conversion to ES6 arrow functions and immediately started getting reports of rendering errors in old browsers. But upon further inspection, it looks like Firefox supported arrow functions all the way back as far as version 45, which just happens to be the version that the current version of Firefox ESR is reporting in the user agent string. So, we've updated our redirect logic to support Firefox (tested up to date ESR on Kali) as far back as version 45. The change should be visible in production tonight.\n\nUnfortunately, during that conversion, we also started using an ES6+ Exponentiation Operator in one place, but it looks like exponentiation operators were not supported until Firefox 52. So, if you need a short term workaround, change the user agent string to bypass the first issue, then search for and edit the following from `complexity = Math.log(complexity ** password.length) * (1 / options.strengthScaleFactor);` to `complexity = Math.log(Math.pow(complexity, password.length)) * (1 / options.strengthScaleFactor);` ... or just wait for tonight's deploy :-) We haven't yet done a full system test with these changes, so it's possible that other ES6 or ES7 features that are not well supported are impacting other functionality in FF ESR.\n\nUnfortunately, because there is no security impact this report is not bounty-eligible, but I'm marking this as Resolved so you at least get the reputation bump.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-01T15:52:15.195Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T15:52:15.195Z","actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"bhenner_","url":"/bhenner_"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1882748,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::NotEligibleForBounty","message":"No security impact so no bounty, but you have our appreciation (and some reputation points)","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-01T15:53:05.244Z","updated_at":"2017-08-01T15:53:05.244Z","actor":{"url":"/legalrobot","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/001/601/0f164c3d9618b04b006b859517ff032ec57ab42a_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Legal Robot"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1957621,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Requesting full disclosure.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-27T00:00:10.426Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T00:00:10.426Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2023309,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-09-26T00:00:13.457Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T00:00:13.457Z","actor":{"url":"/legalrobot","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/001/601/0f164c3d9618b04b006b859517ff032ec57ab42a_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Legal Robot"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
