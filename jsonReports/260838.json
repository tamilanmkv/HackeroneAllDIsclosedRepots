I think usage of special characters should be controlled and checked again by you guys . as you are filtering out payloads which potentially contain multiple special characters but you are allowing usage of special characters in under few circumstances . \n\nI am also attaching a video .

Not just like Kim Dotcom, but an actual URL. In 2003, a PETA activist named Karin Robertson [changed her legal name](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2003-08-01-goveg_x.htm) to `GoVeg.com`.\n\nAs I mentioned in report #254927 (publicly disclosed), there is no demonstrable security risk from allowing a user to enter their first name as something with special characters like `\u003e\u003c)))*\u003e I ♡ sushi`. Obviously, this is not what we anticipate from most users, but people have certainly changed their legal names to unusual things like `Goveg.com` or `\"The\" Dan Miller Experience` (including the quotes). Alas, we should allow those people to benefit from our service and sign up with their legal names :-)\n\nPractically, this would really only be concerning if the name was somehow evaluated and led to an additional bug. More commonly, we just see names with non-English characters like `François St. John`, which has both a c-cedilla and a period.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-16T22:57:58.962Z","updated_at":"2017-08-16T22:57:58.962Z","actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1957504,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-26T22:56:20.833Z","updated_at":"2017-08-26T22:56:20.833Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"danrubins","cleared":false,"url":"/danrubins","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/021/222/c1d0d51f40e0c570e2153b6801fe54c997c757f0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1957565,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Not sure why you would like to disclose this publicallly   , As you have closed it as informative - this issue may not be considered as something of an unexpected behaviour . from the viewpoint of your program as you try to maintain transparency and disclose a lot of reports I think it may be a valid enough reason .
