Email spoofing is a tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns because people are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a legitimate source. The goal of email spoofing is to get recipients to open, and possibly even respond to, a solicitation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n1. goto http://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html\n2. Enter domain name: 18f.com and click spf record if any under \"Does my domain already have an SPF record? What is it? Is it valid?\"\n3. The SPF record  is observed as below\n\"Found v=spf1 record for 18f.gov: \nv=spf1 include:spf.mandrillapp.com ?all\"\n\nwhich is set to neutral,Neutral-The SPF record specifies explicitly that nothing can be said about validity.\n\n\n ","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":2,"voters":["cuso4","saurabhmeher"],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":81503,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://federalist.18f.gov","max_severity":"high"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1957862,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportTitleUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-27T07:06:59.988Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T07:06:59.988Z","additional_data":{"old_title":"Email Spoofing","new_title":"Email Spoofing - SPF record set to Neutral"},"actor":{"username":"ramakanthk35","cleared":false,"url":"/ramakanthk35","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gsa_bbp","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1957865,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"In addition to above checking, \n1.
