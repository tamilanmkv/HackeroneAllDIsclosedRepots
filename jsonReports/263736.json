Email spoofing is a tactic used in phishing and spam campaigns because people are more likely to open an email when they think it has been sent by a legitimate source. The goal of email spoofing is to get recipients to open, and possibly even respond to, a solicitation.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1.goto http://www.kitterman.com/spf/validate.html\n2.Enter domain name: cloud.gov and click spf record if any under \"Does my domain already have an SPF record? What is it? Is it valid?\"\n3.The SPF record is observed as below \n\"Found v=spf1 record for cloud.gov: \nv=spf1 include:spf.mandrillapp.com ?all \"\n\nwhich is set to neutral,Neutral-The SPF record specifies explicitly that nothing can be said about validity.\n\nIn addition to above checking,\n\nI used https://emkei.cz/ and send a test mail using cloud.gov domain which was delivered successfully.This further confirms that the emails spoofed","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":4,"voters":["cuso4","saurabhmeher","sufian_saoree","liss"],"severity":{"rating":"none","score":0.0,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":81467,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1957873,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-27T07:22:38.714Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T07:22:38.714Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":null,"new_severity":"Medium","old_severity_id":null,"new_severity_id":71149},"actor":{"username":"ramakanthk35","cleared":false,"url":"/ramakanthk35","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gsa_bbp","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1957965,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Hi,\n\nThank you for the report.
