A fix was quickly pushed for this, but now I've found a workaround. I'm reporting this on the newrelic-vip program because it directly ties to a issue with Synthetics, surrounding the add users permissions feature. \n\nYou managed to obscure the names of the accounts on the user management section: \n\n{F220098}\n\nBut, I found that I can still harvest names from the Synthetics section to add users https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/permissions. \n\n{F220099}\n\n## Steps to reproduce: \n\n1. Add a new user to the account (https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/users/new)\n1. Enter \"123\" as the name and \"123@gmail.com\" as the email\n1. Make them a \"user\" base role.\n1. Click add user button.\n1. Now, navigate to https://synthetics.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/permissions\n2. Click on the plus button next to \"People\", once you've made a permission group (if you haven't already got one) \n3. You'll be able to see the full names of any email on any account \n\nI've rated this using the CVSS calculator as Medium (4.3) - but depending on whether you feel that this is \"High\" confidentiality, it can be raised to a 6.5 - I was trying to be realistic. \n\nLet me know if you're unable to reproduce, thanks!

This is an interesting finding, as it really doesn't seem to fit cleanly into any of the categories defined in our policy (a sign that our policy could use some work).\n\nI think this one falls a bit short of \"cross-account access\" â€“ I feel that we've used the term in the past more to describe write access or significant amounts of read access to arbitrary accounts. On the other hand, this feels quite a bit heftier than most of the vulnerabilities in our 'Medium' category.\n\nAt the risk of being arbitrary, I've set the reward towards the higher end of the scale. This will provide a great discussion point for my team to review our current policy; if we do end up classifying vulnerabilities like this as 'High' severity, we will absolutely come back and make sure this reward is updated to reflect that.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-09-12T15:37:26.716Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T15:37:26.716Z","actor":{"url":"/newrelic","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/011/eba06abb23bd6c9c7d719ddafb9fa83bd2d66aaa_original./fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"New Relic"}},"bounty_amount":"1500.0","bounty_currency":"usd","bonus_amount":"0.0","attachments":[{"id":220328,"filename":"rKhNazo.gif","type":"image/gif","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/220/328/a64a8b0081af9a56b51a4adba1ea139e26f976ef/rKhNazo.gif?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22rKhNazo.gif%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27rKhNazo.gif\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fgif\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ5B5ZLR7W%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T143418Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDznwDn3DlLBhpUQR2HsgV%2FXq95UR4rgunTAtaALtJfOwIhAPs6S1Tcddn1VigtqMJZu1ze7EJhUESTAidgv9nNGvTkKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwZmyQg19q82eNvWTYq1wPVa9iL33aSnxoe9uhB7r2aVM0UjDJv7L7h4wpacx0zTD7Cg8zZaNStfUkAQ4PRdT1iVaYXFqr3oEtcRoGLKhag7I7AYV4CfabHIx%2FljtUdbse7EzqrV%2BLQvKbTG6z1i6zNoig4BjAmqV%2BbJNhSJroBCOPElku0SEqEghibUoxjbjpR4CBXjTIJwAUpnCgLLy91sSgp9KNeTgb1AkQk9PEiYIt%2BjjRn7YHGTo0lsLEhUWc0hsx6VLMRCiSyU6pMLzMGyTS6q7VECFtTn5Z0xG6cXCTKHB3pYQ1zLLYN8ml68bLOIBj9DG3soHxXVeXkifKnxu13VQyp3%2Fs7gxFDt1C7HjJ71usGGrh%2BfYBJJFBMGndfS1DoK%2Bopk8YhA2hlX3szEJmyZfm0KUVaG%2FoWbCJlR3fqXIBJ1cKXRlMooUSiLaTSXt07k2ZqF9w0HUl1IdVQzbNbJBH%2BnkPxpioMdR%2BthDqTyEJ4NZO1WuIxKWGZYyMyXsZaWNopcb1ntUTbg6h9jL8PBR4KRpM%2FHAsw70cht3GV%2BEt83AJHQMRTRifsEIkEWjFR47llnjXkbbepxcng%2ByfEEKZRp237bvaIzCz%2FOBASo1zhQretKmelA0U4%2BEADJwrI3hIwr4yRiwY6pAEjctaIC5qKHFIiVu1bdWXuftBXGyVKZyt2TIP%2B2%2FEEDUKSn7h674C0WnV7bDgpkWP3Jm2QA8%2B4oAW2qew892kEhCJxDwZz%2BXR81EJw6%2FG5A5FZJ8bUl63WLiuBkwA0Dx%2Bf%2FkeTcR6awW4gpgHN5q2%2B02FvrdW8HWnLO9b%2FdddTJiHpMjGB2dteCQWg1L0LIQ%2FyL7kCQpQu%2F5PLB76pfiUetgXbFQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=aa0d35e8a08da6187672948cea19959a1f1a8c43dbdef212181b88e8bdca6078"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"newrelic","collaborator":{"username":"jon_bottarini","url":"/jon_bottarini"},"actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1991990,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-09-12T16:00:40.382Z","updated_at":"2017-09-12T16:00:40.382Z","actor":{"username":"ahamlin","cleared":false,"url":"/ahamlin","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/037/071/b10c1e5872fac616ba0f3b67bb1e6e06ba70fe6c_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"newrelic","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1992786,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Appreciate it!
