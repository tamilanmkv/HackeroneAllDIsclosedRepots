We get \"Something went wrong\" Response. \nFor Example (try changing yelp.com to yelk.com)\nhttps://hackerone.com/redirect?signature=829727b4188c43dcf394fd841fd19a8b7f391bd1\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yelk.com%2F\n\n\nNow Lets look at a sample Hackerone Redirect URL of a IDN HOMOGRAPH Link:\n\nCASE 2:\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/redirect?signature=e021a53caee6e288347ad14e95648ba6d8fb53cb\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xn--elp-cfd.com%2F\n\n{***Got this link generated by posting https://www.ﾑテlp.com/ on hackerone platform.  NOTE: Here \"ﾑテlp.com\" is actually an IDN and its punycode version is \"xn--elp-cfd.com\" \u0026 that's why it automatically got converted by Hackerone to its punycode representation in the above URL****}\n\nNow lets replace \"xn--elp-cfd.com\" to the original IDN i.e \"ﾑテlp.com\" in the above URL.\n\nAs Infered from CASE 1, Upon changing any character in the URL parameter, Ideally we should get an error and the link should become invalid.\n\nBut,that is not the case here when we are dealing with IDN Links. The link is still valid even after changing value of the URL parameter-From Punycode version to IDN.\n\nHave a look at the changed URL here:\nhttps://hackerone.com/redirect?signature=e021a53caee6e288347ad14e95648ba6d8fb53cb\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.%D1%83elp.com%2F\n\n***NOTE: Till Now the External Link Warning Page Displays : \"https://www.xn--elp-cfd.com/\"***\n\nNow, IF we Add extra \"//\" after \"https:%3A%2F%2F\" in the above url we get the following URL:\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/redirect?signature=e021a53caee6e288347ad14e95648ba6d8fb53cb\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2F//www.%D1%83elp.com%2F\n\n***You can see that the above link displays \"https:///www.yelp.com/\" but actually redirects us to \"https://www.xn--elp-cfd.com/\" ***\n\nAnd thus the current fix for Homograph attack seems to be bypassed.

Apart from this homograph bypass, there's one more vulnerability in the external warning URL page that caught my eye recently. \n\n                              DESCRIPTION \u0026 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\n\nI was planning to report it as separate issue.\n\nBut as that could also be fixed along with the above issue I decided to post it as a comment here itself. Its up to you to decide both of these as separate or as a combined report. Proceeding further, Here's what i found:\n\n Lets have a look at the URI scheme:\n\nscheme:[//[user[:password]@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]\n\nYou may infer that something like \"http://user:pass@xyz.com\" would authenticate us to xyz.com with user=user and password=pass.\n\n\nNow, have a look at the following URL:\n\nhttp://1222222222/  \nIt's not like the usual URL you may see. It takes us to :\nhttps://72.217.161.142/\n\n{ Note: 1222222222  is the decimal conversion of the IP address 72.217.161.142. A Decimal converted IP address could be used by the browser to visit the IP address. }\n\nSo, from the above we can see that something like :\n\nhttps://xyz.com@1222222222/ \n\nwhen given to the browser would try to authenticate us with username=\"xyz.com\"  on the IP address 1222222222 i.e \n72.217.161.142\n\n                                        EXPLOIT OR POC:\n\nI posted such a URL on the hackerone.com platform.\n\nPlease visit the Following URL:\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/redirect?signature=d674772ce6d1c337debe8fee906b0fa5a03f69ca\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackerone.com%401222222222%2Freports%2F12332\n\nYou would find that the \"1222222222\" is marked as red in the field, which demonstrates that \"1222222222\" is the main domain the user is going to visit. \n\nNow, \n\nI tried to change any of the characters in the above URL but that makes the link invalid. \nNow, When we try to add extra \"//\" in the url parameter above we find:\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/redirect?signature=d674772ce6d1c337debe8fee906b0fa5a03f69ca\u0026url=https%3A%2F%2F//www.hackerone.com%401222222222%2Freports%2F12332\n\nThe red mark is removed and a typical user/team member/admin is most likely to fall for this attack.\n\n                                     SAMPLE ATTACK SCENARIO:\n\nThe poor victim clicks on the link to open a webpage (thinking of visiting \"hackerone.com\" ) that is controlled by the attacker.\nThe attacker most probably has hosted some website similar to hackerone.com's main login page \u0026 displays a fake error message indicating \"You have be logged out. Signin again to continue.\"\n\nThe attacker then exploits the victim to gain unauthorized access to the victim/users/team member/admin accounts.\n\n                                         MITIGATION:\n\nCombining these two reports we can infer that the main problem has arised because the external warning link page allowed us to edit some content of the URL. i.e:\n\nAbility to Interchange Punycode to Unicode in the first report\n\u0026\nAbility to add extra \"//\" in the second one.\n\nSo, the most probable fix that i think should be :\n\nEnforcing strict length based restriction on the complete redirect URL. i.e Storing the length of the URL while creating such links \u0026 checking it everytime the link is requested again. \n\u0026 Disallowing any additional characters like \"//\".\n\n\nAlthough Hackerone.com has previously worked for some mitigations on this but the above two reports seems to a bypass for the current protection mechanism. \n\nPLEASE RECOMMEND IF I NEED TO REPORT THIS AS AN SEPARATE
