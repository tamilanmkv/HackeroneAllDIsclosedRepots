for the delay getting back to you. I'm closing this ticket. Polldaddy uses oAuth through WordPress.com to login. When you change password you're changing the password on WordPress.com, not on Polldaddy.com. Perhaps the account page should be clearer about this and the implications but I'm not aware of any other similar site describing that situation.\n\nYou can disconnect Polldaddy from WordPress.com on https://wordpress.com/me/security/connected-applications but if someone is already logged into Polldaddy they'll remain logged in until Polldaddy tries to authenticate again.
