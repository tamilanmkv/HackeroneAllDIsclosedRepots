Let me try again.\n\nI understand how CSRF attacks work in general, and I understand how this is an instance of one. We're both clear on that point, it seems, and there is no disagreement on the facts.\n\nHowever, these comment forms are public. The worst you can do is impersonate an Author, which are already allowed to be shared among multiple users in the first place.\n\n(Aside: I've been debating renaming Author to Persona to make this more intuitive for people to understand.)\n\nWhile CSRF enforcement is a good idea to leave enabled everywhere (hence, it is a bug), being able to CSRF a public form when CAPTCHAs are disabled, when the maximum impact is that a message is posed that can easily be fixed by hiding/deleting it, and there's no avenue for greater client-side or server-side impact (no XSS or RCE, no overwriting other people's data), it becomes more of a Github issue rather than a HackerOne issue. Neither the confidentiality. integrity, or availability of existing data or systems are violated.\n\nCSRF on public forms with the worst case nuclear option impact of \"submits a comment in someone else's name when CAPTCHAs aren't enforced, which is in turn easily removed\" is a valid bug, but it's not something anyone will lose sleep over.\n\nThe bug, thus, is fixed: https://github.com/paragonie/airship/commit/c43c6d564fa5a2b5ccdd32e67ba7c10737b19b0a\n\nI was debating only checking the CSRF tokens in situations where the CAPTCHA wasn't being enforced, but the redundant checks are a better outcome than the complexity that logic would entail, and I'd rather not make an unauditable mess out of the logic here.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-10-03T16:11:41.421Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T16:11:41.421Z","actor":{"username":"paragonie-scott","cleared":false,"url":"/paragonie-scott","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/051/441/089de22b2f1b80a1e57a2792318dede5cbad81db_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"ranjit_p","url":"/ranjit_p"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"paragonie","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2041317,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Using CSRF attack,Here attacker can post any number of comment to a Blog post.\nAttacker send a link and when user open that link comment will created and victim does not even know how comment is created.\nThats the different matter that victim can later delete those unnecessary comment or can hide them.\nits a Client-side bug and has same impact as XSS(both required user to open malicious link).\nAs 2017 OWASP CSRF listed in top 10 vulnerability\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2017-Top_10\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-10-03T16:29:10.430Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T16:29:10.430Z","actor":{"username":"ranjit_p","cleared":false,"url":"/ranjit_p","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"paragonie","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2041322,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"And the main point is that it Bypassed your CSRF protection mechanism.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-10-03T16:32:19.876Z","updated_at":"2017-10-03T16:32:19.876Z","actor":{"username":"ranjit_p","cleared":false,"url":"/ranjit_p","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"paragonie","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2041424,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\u003e Attacker send a link and when user open that link comment will created and victim does not even know how comment is created.\n\u003e Thats the different matter that victim can later delete those unnecessary comment or can hide them.\n\u003e its a Client-side bug and has same impact as XSS(both required user to open malicious link).\n\nUh, no, that's not an XSS.

That's really the best anyone can hope to do here.\n\nAlso, you don't need to \"chain with CSRF\", because if you get XSS on the user's machine, CSRF should be assumed to be bypassed. The only thing that isn't bypassed in such a scenario is a CAPTCHA, which is in turn a bad UX so most companies will, stuck between a rock and a hard place, decide to just focus on preventing XSS in the first place.\n\nCompanies have to set boundaries. Otherwise, \"If the user intentionally installs this malware their keystrokes and mouse movements can be stolen\" would be an acceptable bug report for password theft.
