The authors of the application correctly observed that parsing untrusted YAML is dangerous (since it can serialize more or less arbitrary objects), so they monkey-patched the spec parser to use `Psych.safe_load` set from `config/initializers/forbidden_yaml.rb`.\n\nHowever, `YAML.load` is called directly when parsing the gem's checksum file in `Gem::Package#read_checksums`. Using classes accessible within the application, I was able to turn this into a call to `Marshal.load` on attacker-controlled data. From there, I was able to use known Marshal exploitation techniques to achieve code execution on the server (I'm omitting some details here for brevity so that I can submit this report right away).\n\nA proof of concept, `poc.gem`, is attached. Run the exploit with the following command:\n`cat poc.gem | curl -H 'Content-Type: application/gzip' --data-binary @- -H 'Authorization: █████' https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems`\n\nI ran the attached PoC twice.
