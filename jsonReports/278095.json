But that protection is weak and can be bypassed. So an attacker can redirect victim on another host instead of highlighted host. Also, it possible to redirect victim on a IDN homograph website.\n\nHost filtration can be bypassed using whitespace characters like `%0D`,`%0A`,`%00`,`%09` etc.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Use this markdown code `[Go to yelp.com](https://yelp.com%0A.evil.com%5C@x)` in a comment \n2. Click on `Go to yelp.com` link.\n3. External link warning page will be shown \n4. `yelp.com` will be highlighted as targeted Host.\n5. Click on Proceed button.\n6. You will be redirected on https://yelp.com.evi.com (a subdomain of evil.com)\n7. Done\n\n####Using IDN homograph : \n\n1. Try `[Yelp.com](https://yelp.com%0A.Ñƒelp.com%5C@x)`\n2. Click on `Yelp.com` \n3. `yelp.com` will be highlighted\n4. You will be redirected on https://yelp.com.xn--elp-cfd.com/@x after clicking on **Proceed** button\n5.
