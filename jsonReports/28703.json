Create a new account and use the email address as the password.\r\n- 2. Reset your password and choose your email address as the password. \r\n\r\nIn both cases, the application does not prevent this decision. \r\n\r\nTo improve the password strength, the application should avoid 1-to-1 usage of personal information as the account password. \r\n\r\nI'm aware that you're using rate-limiting to prevent brute-force attacks, but in that case it's just a single email/email authentication request.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think about it.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSebastian","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-11-27T21:09:53.007Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-216840525.2560405,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":130181,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Many thanks for your report!\n\nWe're aware that password complexity restrictions are a good best practice, and we're in the process of implementing them.
