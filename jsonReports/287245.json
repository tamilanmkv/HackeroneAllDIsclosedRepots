By abusing a bug that I discovered in Ruby's native resolver, I am able to bypass the SSRF filter and could potentially scan your internal network.\n\n# Vulnerability Details\n\nHackerOne uses the [private_address_check](https://github.com/jtdowney/private_address_check) gem to prevent SSRF on the \"Integrations\" panel: https://hackerone.com/{BBP}/integrations. The actual filtering takes place in [lib/private_address_check.rb](https://github.com/jtdowney/private_address_check/blob/c95a538542d8d5bd8b969d9d8d95753e74fb7e52/lib/private_address_check.rb). The process starts by attempting to resolve the user-supplied URL with `Resolv::getaddresses` and then compares the returned value with a the values in the blacklist. I discovered a bug in `Resolv::getaddresses` that allows me to return an empty value, which is not included in the blacklist and therefore completely bypasses any checks.\n\n```ruby\ndef resolves_to_private_address?(hostname)\n    ips = Resolv.getaddresses(hostname)\n    ips.any? do |ip| \n      private_address?(ip)\n    end\nend\n```\n\nThe bypass consists of providing encoded IP addresses that when forwarded on to the operating system in `lib/resolv.rb` return an empty value.\n\n```\nhttp://0177.1:22/\nhttp://0x7f.1:22/\nhttp://127.000.001:22/\n```\n\nI discovered the bug in `Resolv::getaddresses` by running it on different Linux machines and noticing that the outputs vary. Until the Ruby Core come up with a better solution I suggest not relying on this library for any security-related features.\n\n**Machine 1** returned the following:\n\n```\nirb(main):001:0\u003e require 'resolv'\nirb(main):002:0\u003e Resolv.getaddresses(\"127.000.000.1\")\n=\u003e []\n```\n\nAnd **Machine 2** returned this:\n\n```\nirb(main):001:0\u003e require 'resolv'\nirb(main):002:0\u003e Resolv.getaddresses(\"127.000.000.1\")\n=\u003e [\"127.0.0.1\"]\n```\n\n# Exploit\n\nAdmittedly, I was unable to actually exploit this issue and I am still playing around to see if I can exfiltrate valuable data. The current issue only consists of a filter bypass.\n\n# Mitigation\n\nI would suggest using `Socket.getaddrinfo()` as it is more reliable and is not affected by this bug. Something along the lines of this should work:\n\n```ruby\nrequire \"socket\"\n...\ndef resolves_to_private_address?(hostname)\n  ips = Socket.getaddrinfo(hostname, nil).sample[3]\n  ips.any? do |ip| \n    private_address?(ip)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nMy suggested patch can be found here: {F236338}.","weakness":{"id":68,"name":"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":236338,"file_name":"private_address_check.rb.patch","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/236/338/c4d5f99300f382c15f80045ba1ad2ef17315989e/private_address_check.rb.patch?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22private_address_check.rb.patch%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27private_address_check.rb.patch\u0026response-content-type=text%2Fx-ruby\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQX46P3UGI%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T143839Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIGvlFSN4tPhAu4V7v5pc7%2F6eSiik7IhHLLD01kiqhVWYAiB5Dz9ea%2BLZD%2BpLtagj4O%2BjrW%2FPBVXyOw%2FvfPhYOWnLJyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMy2N4EHiSo%2FA9G2F0KtcDeo3CuylmH%2BuFka3rGPAArFX7PEojyq8EAAWPijF4XtZGXNXpmeQR1pzTOcI0Rm%2Fvja%2BwHd%2F8TxJsGVWeh%2Flk5vjiIRZT9GPW9u3ZycCrjqMci9iGhBM6uwkYQOmABA3poTj0CyTV9vU5PwMEPHFcEacwKutRiCveofJe7f8Tu4WHR%2BNU7KEmxqtXpvAXj8hQLxFVDU25WgaPgk2b4mSQSaY%2FPywLP4TuBkCMbSNVoBG2JTX5CaBeJN5iElkzZ62K%2FGVGXrbaaNyPhn%2BB8rXIjbw78eQJEkHjvT8OqfCHAYP5f%2B4IhYfTll35nE7LIUoMiLvBq6tkN5BWqoopu%2Fpju60lSqB656qlcZeAK9f5orDqJzDwlKMnoVzqvkUrUy9bmk%2BkxGW97VVmeHZ1t0v3wof%2BrT0QSrWeBO35JesCQ%2BdFE8O%2BxosSdP7tU4A%2BDPpxwomZQHAAcNR9Aywt%2FQ8Qbv894mkGzt9WDwY%2FFN8jeU3O6C%2BmyqjrgMf7nGycFeD87%2Bsgs8CikLj6%2BhBYFpskae2EppYXvqHFDwWaJKFLdI8X3NNsrRpCnIXL5GUe8p%2BBySjVvE4SnyaxoJD5sUMGcJj0QQyQGgO22eUI1ATV1DsO%2BN%2BaLLxtMPqIkYsGOqYBTa91vvmG%2BK28LWqLSYG8vhMxYQ%2Fxj6PD70iq5MyM9pLPu1bgCyqJfX2mwm9fHA6UDqgGoerI%2Bnp3Q6V4OYY0E3hEAx7T8Q%2FppO8G%2BTgH7gaNlLC%2Fng4%2BkFoIuXyVGb7q1PCueRn4pqAqwTocflxXYcQQGudKiKkzrNHGy4UeULO76lDgSIcMEtI1vIJ76b2MxFEJwq4lWhln09Xn3ksb8maUXRDeCg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=e1649ac9a09992cfae228941cef18c8681cb58c9cc5668e53dafb63be6feabc1","file_size":697,"type":"text/x-ruby"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-12-09T18:36:16.465Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-121118543.35473207,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":28,"voters":["jensec","sp1d3rs","cdl","hunter","michiel","bl4de","yumi","ysx","0nlymohammed","gamliel","and 18 more..."],"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2137840,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi @edio - We are investigating this now, thanks for your report.
