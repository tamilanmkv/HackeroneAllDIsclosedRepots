I prefer to do some tests that could not lead to any disruption (even if this seems to be a test infrastructure), but for example the following request returns 200 :\n\n```\nPUT ████████HTTP/1.1\nHost: ██████myteksi.net\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.9 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: fr,fr-FR;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3\nConnection: close\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n```\nAnd the response is the following \n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 \nDate: Fri, 12 Jan 2018 09:17:36 GMT\nContent-Type: application/xml\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: close\nServer: Tengine/2.2.1\n```\n\nFollowing the description of the REST API, I think that an attacker could modify any propertie regarding the current instances registered or even register a new one with his own settings. As I am not sure if there is some production behind, I choose to report it directly without doing any modification on the current systems. \n\n## Browsers Verified In:\n\nN/A\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Go to █████████ for the dashboard access (read only)\n  1. Issue for example the above HTTP requestand check the server response (or any of the requests described in Netflix documentation)\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * List any additional material (e.g. screenshots, video, logs, etc.)\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts,\n\nKind regards,\n\nReptou\n\n## Impact\n\nFrom my perspective, this could help an attacker registers his custom AWS EC2 instance into an application and make it part of the service load balancing provided by Eureka.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":13,"voters":["europa","danila","eveeez","whitesector","cr4xerbik4sh","japz","asad_anwar","nafisaqil","smither","karlstephen","and 3 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":1668,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.myteksi.net","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2279829,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi Reptou,\n\nThank you!
