This could lead to phishing and confusing users since the text is being returned within the actual website.\n\n**Description:** You can take the URL https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message= and change the \"message\" parameter to any text (and you can encode it with percent encoding) and it will be returned as text on the loaded page.\n\n**Platform(s) Affected:** Tested in Chrome 63.0.3239.132 (Official Build) (64-bit), should work in most situations\n\n**User Identification:**████████ but N/A\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Take the URL https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message=\n2. Change the message parameter text to anything\n3. Copy and paste the new URL into a browser\n4. You'll notice the text is returned clearly in a red box at the top of the loaded page\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  I attached an image with an example payload.\n\nThanks,\nJack\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could use this to phish and steal user accounts by setting it up with a convincing, percent-encoded message to redirect them to a site with a fake login that steals their information.\nExample of an attacker payload: https://sso.showmax.com/auth/failure?message=%47%6F%20%74%6F%20%65%76%69%6C%2E%63%6F%6D\n\nAs you can see, at first glance this URL doesn't give away the text in the box, making it even more convincing and dangerous. A real attacker could obviously make a more convincing payload though that said something like my attached image.","bounty_amount":"128.0","formatted_bounty":"$128","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":254228,"file_name":"ba14f2b6badedcdd6d488be498b35446.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/254/228/3e96da87fa5983745cabb680f3e4292bf04373a3/ba14f2b6badedcdd6d488be498b35446.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22ba14f2b6badedcdd6d488be498b35446.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ba14f2b6badedcdd6d488be498b35446.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQZ6XJQAFX%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T144203Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCICOXvTwruabcCgvIvFwMLdD63I7wJU77da1qgiZ0fcgxAiEA2iE07eZZp56fgfdC8AqwOSxwRZmRPTllfbb0Tbxm9MYqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDDj8b5u85%2FF%2BsdTPzirXA4Q26F09GEsezqo%2FDgU%2BN1ov6Z0mJp8NxapcqVf3Oua4oSgb5aQpGLsAXhdiEaUoWsXCtHv4ujnK6mqk7E9O2WKXNjLPpfRYiEQ71CFLUQhpz1VlTUi8AaLKGm2tOz7W6Dg1b3xxjZfihfmfR6OPDce2Z600EmMbP%2BHpciOGhSEuGzpexDOGRgw4ix10R9155b0anW3PU4UD8Ge2PEqMj3%2FF8sUIZw7AbQUjqw1Ce9mhpbUZZfOQoy0pJ2t8c2T4BgwOhgN1b3fN5pnsElvfIuzUPOy6b490pAv%2BCqmrijPnhfxCFLh0JKO8JRVj8XuMyTl5hv6jZDQVsJsMAcXPrqar7TkmvMjkI%2BN4yDBkbH5NrA1VDNa0of9Y0Ob501UWmq3Ap93egI9bfOc0SJJuPizy58SnDrtHr6nSjyefAjpNL04P0FK2SzeJsSTTwhywI6YMiTBjKrFeC2gfVf8aFUGCIZ5qqWFJVDfVcx%2Fn8CXnNOSFJ4E0AOZCD2bzMOr0zl8cL%2FhRzxRrehVzw%2FTkoxOt0l7KmRzdTPKmnS8oozD2Cyle0v45%2B7sfTk9r6klH%2F2VLwfVaCQMt2wCz6DqzbD4MYWDvCaIbvvrbK5sZIedyaPkbcLAvRDDCjpGLBjqlAU9SRSSUKO2aO0kQO%2BnmnceQh7DtfcGkOUk0CXICIwNK0fD%2BqaMjTEwcyVBBW5oqUBOFZj7aKeXh%2FN47wB%2B%2BNyAlnunaZYfVUOsQGCMywCeVElq5cKhikJpo4VRBfaWxpOo%2Fjfp%2BVIoSdni5MQ6uLsqSIiA%2Fcm2GDHTprLxSZr5sstp5PxiiN53WteMJJW5bqZgjokn7B89wleOrzCJV84UVJ4OV7g%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=c2d8897aace528f61681e9930cb3c38452212c55f14a68933fe2c90617271c1f","file_size":57452,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-02-15T14:03:49.134Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-115259893.94854203,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":21,"voters":["thaivu","muon4","bl4de","hackedbrain","brodie_codie","eveeez","r3y","jackb898","t4ym","m7mdharoun","and 11 more..."],"structured_scope":{"databaseId":2977,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://www.showmax.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2286844,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"You are absolutely right, that it is out of official scope.
