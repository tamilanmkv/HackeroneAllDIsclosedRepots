F259492\n\n**Description:**\nPrior to public disclosure of a vulnerability, and also prior to a resolution status, it is possible to determine information about who a particular researcher has reported issues to if a bounty/thanks has been issued.\n\nFor example, a researcher after receiving the bounty email may tweet something like: \"I just got $xxxx for reporting SQLi on HackerOne!\". Unbeknownst to them it is currently possible to translate this into: \"I just got $xxxx for reporting SQLi *in MegaCorp* on HackerOne!\", a motivated individual simply need look at a certain area in the researcher's public profile.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\nFor example,\n1.  I have reported an issue Ubiquiti Networks\n2. They have not yet fixed the issue, however they have awarded a bounty\n3. On my main profile page this is not listed as disclosable activity F259487\n4. On the thanks page for Ubiquiti Networks I am not listed F259488, F259489\n5. However, on the thanks page on my profile Ubiquiti Networks **is** listed F259491\nI reported three issues to them (note even though it says the total is two, the existence of a valid third can be implied by the reputation column â€“ since no reputation would be gained for an invalid report). If a motivated individual tracked these statistics they could infer the same kind of information by looking at diffs, say at regular site crawl intervals.\n\n---\n\nProposed mitigation: only update the publicly visible reputation gain split by company when a report has been resolved/closed (similar to when things are announced on the \"Hacktivity\" tab today).\n\n## Impact\n\nPrior to public disclosure of a vulnerability, and also prior to a resolution status, it is possible to determine information about who a particular researcher has reported issues to if a bounty/thanks has been issued that generates a reputation gain.\nThis may be used, in addition to anonymised information that the researcher may have been encouraged to share (by yourselves), in order to gain a head start on discovering the vector before a fix has been issued.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information

@aidantwoods - thanks for your report. This is expected behavior though. HackerOne doesn't leak anything about the selected CWE nor do we encourage to tweet about it.

There's no incentive (besides some reputation) to focus on duplicates, since it's unlikely you'll get a bounty for it.

Is a lot easier to find a vulnerability if you know where to look and what you're looking for.\n\n\u003e nor do we encourage to tweet about it\n\nI think the wording of the email could be improved, it's not entirely clear (perhaps remove the title of the report so at least that isn't disclosed if someone shares a screenshot of the email â€“ note that sharing the email (which itself encourages tweeting about it) would reveal both the vulnerability and the company it affects).\n\nProvided this is intended behaviour, all information included in this report is therefore already intentionally publicly available as far as I can tell. I would ask that at least in the goal of improving the awareness of this *feature* that this report is publicly disclosed.\n\nAdditionally, it might be better to make this whole process more obvious and just mark on someones profile explicitly when they file an issue, and to whom, so that the fact that this activity is intentionally public is a little more obvious (might help prevent the admittedly unlikely scenario described above).","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-02-02T11:13:51.246Z","updated_at":"2018-02-02T11:13:51.246Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"aidantwoods","cleared":false,"url":"/aidantwoods","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2345806,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"We generally don't disclose N/A reports, but given that this might be helpful for others to read, I'm going ahead and disclose this.
