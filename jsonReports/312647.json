Also there are some protections in place to make sure that the user can view the linked content, the said protections can be bypassed by adding a query string parameter to the link containing the value \n```\n?source_topic_id={victim-topic-id}\n```\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Login as an administrator to Discourse and create a topic which can only be viewed by the staff.\n2. Copy the topic's id from the topic's page. the topic id can be found by browsing the topic and then copying the number in the end of the url (`http://localhost:4000/t/{topic-name}/{topic-id}`)\n3. Login with a non-admin user.\n4. Go to any topic you have access to, and type in the following reply:\n```\nhttp://localhost:80/t/blablabla/?source_topic_id=29\n```\nplease note that the port should 80 or 443 even if the url of your local installation is a different (probably some software bug)\n5. Wait for the preview to load and see that you can see topic's content.\n\n## Root cause\nThe following piece of code determines if the logged-in user is capable of viewing the post/topic :\n\n```\n        def can_see_post?(post, source_topic)\n          return false if post.nil? || post.hidden || post.trashed? || post.topic.nil?\n          Guardian.new.can_see_post?(post) || same_category?(post.topic.category, source_topic)\n        end\n\n        def can_see_topic?(topic, source_topic)\n          return false if topic.nil? || topic.trashed? || topic.private_message?\n          Guardian.new.can_see_topic?(topic) || same_category?(topic.category, source_topic)\n        end\n```\nas can be seen here: https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/onebox/engine/discourse_local_onebox.rb#L113\n\nHowever, the source_topic parameter is controlled directly by user input:\n```\nsource_topic_id = @url[/[\u0026?]source_topic_id=(\\d+)/, 1].to_i\n```\nas can be seen here: \nhttps://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/master/lib/onebox/engine/discourse_local_onebox.rb#L47\nSo if we pass in the same topic id as the one we are trying to view, basically the function same_category will always return true, effectively bypassing any protection in place.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker will be able to access all private topics and posts on Discourse.","bounty_amount":"256.0","formatted_bounty":"$256","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-03-17T18:26:47.394Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-112652209.88858013,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":17,"voters":["sp1d3rs","kapytein","hunter","muon4","spam404","emitrani","asad0x01_","eveeez","malcolmx","apapedulimu","and 7 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2353607,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Oups, I have posted an incorrect link in step 4.
