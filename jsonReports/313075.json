Why would I want to reveal the scopes, to allow more people to further exploit/enumerate the resolved finding or even bypass the patches on the affected domain, I would rather kept it as a secret by suppressing all necessary information and let them do their own enumeration/exploitation. \n\nNevertheless, it is up to hackerone team to consider this feature. I believes there are more clients who will feel the same as me, and @willx is also one of them who think this information should be suppress. I do not see any cons in this approach; this change will only bring benefit to your platform and increase more confidence in using it. \n\nThank you.\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-02-16T14:00:09.467Z","updated_at":"2018-02-16T14:00:09.467Z","actor":{"username":"eqbang","cleared":false,"url":"/eqbang","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/201/396/b1a6941b3b1fb2a32dcad26e2a8840c74ec2d05b_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2393189,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @bangrorox, \n\nThank you for the additional information!
