I believe this is fixed by:\n\nhttps://secure.phabricator.com/D19117\nhttps://secure.phabricator.com/D19118\n\nAfter these changes, we no longer try to guess whether browsers will interpret a given `\u003ca /\u003e` tag as a link to an external site or not, and instead just explicitly add `rel=\"noreferrer\"` to all links with user-controlled targets.\n\nThis is less robust in one sense: we must remember to add `rel=\"noreferrer\"` to new user-controlled links. However, I'm not confident we can ever reasonably detect all patterns which browsers will accept as protocol-relative URIs. Beyond backslashes (in #306414) and newline (here), it also seems that tabs are acceptable.\n\nLet me know if you catch any issues with the fix.
