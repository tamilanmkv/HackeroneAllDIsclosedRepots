If you submit someone else's username, followed by a null-byte (`%00`), you'll get an error indicating that the username has been taken (expected behaviour). Same with `%20`. However, if you submit the username followed by a control character, such as a new line (`%0a`), the request will go through and you'll be signed up.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of consequences of this. The first is that your profile can't be viewed (which also means you can't update your own settings!). You'll get a 404.\r\n\r\nThe second is that any bug reports you submit will look like another user submitted them. Again, not that big of a deal.\r\n\r\n### Proof-of-Concept\r\n1. Browse to https://hackerone.com/users/sign_up\r\n2. Enter any details, make sure your username is followed by `%0a` (use Burp to append it)\r\n3. Confirm your email, then login\r\n4. Click your profile picture in the top right\r\n5. You'll get a 404\r\n\r\nIf you need anymore information just shout,\r\nCheers,\r\nJack","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-04-10T04:12:54.814Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-236860356.15882072,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":7,"voters":["sw33tlie","japz","cryptographer","spetr0x","hdarji","dyabla","12345abcd"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":13022,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"The only other scenario I can think of where this could be used in is when you assign a bug to another user.
