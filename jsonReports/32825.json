Actually, the reason to it is due to the CNAME of the meda.vine.co-DNS-entry:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmedia.vine.co\r\n -\u003e media.vine.co is an alias for vines.s3.amazonaws.com.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis might have worked before, since there is a bucket with the name \"vines\". However, these are the rules for how CNAMEs to S3 are working currently:\r\n\r\n\u003e Customizing Amazon S3 URLs with CNAMEs\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e Depending on your needs, you might not want \"s3.amazonaws.com\" to appear on your website or service. For example, if you host your website images on Amazon S3, you might prefer http://images.johnsmith.net/ instead of http://johnsmith-images.s3.amazonaws.com/.\r\n\u003e \r\n\u003e The bucket name must be the same as the CNAME. So http://images.johnsmith.net/filename would be the same as http://images.johnsmith.net.s3.amazonaws.com/filename if a CNAME were created to map images.johnsmith.net to images.johnsmith.net.s3.amazonaws.com.\r\n\r\nSo what happens here is actually that, since media.vine.co is pointing to S3, S3 is actually checking if there's a bucket with that name. Which in this case was not true. So I was able to claim the bucket media.vine.co and thus, can place content on this URL.\r\n\r\n _You should immediately remove the DNS-entry for media.vine.co pointing to AWS S3._ \r\n\r\nSince I have complete control over the subdomain I can do whatever I want on it. The restriction I have now is that I'm not able to serve anything on the root-URL ( http://media.vine.co/ ) – however – if I would have created the bucket in the correct region (West-1) in AWS, this would've worked.\r\n\r\nCreating a login form that would fool anyone, since it's present on a Vine.co domain.\r\n\r\nPOC-link:\r\nhttp://media.vine.co/login\r\n\r\nPOC-image attached.\r\n\r\nThis is really severe. Foolproof phishing. XSS on vine.co. Potential malware spread through a domain you – in this case – do not control. Extremely painful for the Company Brand.\r\n\r\nPlease make sure you're always going through your DNS-entries so no subdomains are pointing to external services you do not use.\r\n\r\nWe've written an advisory about this at Detectify:\r\nhttp://blog.detectify.com/post/100600514143/hostile-subdomain-takeover-using-heroku-github-desk\r\n\r\nWhere you can read more about this sort of attack.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFrans","bounty_amount":"1680.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,680","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":19491,"file_name":"Screen_Shot_2014-10-26_at_01.38.37.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/019/491/63a59835d3f8a8f614e2f93fece81571eac9d710/Screen_Shot_2014-10-26_at_01.38.37.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Screen_Shot_2014-10-26_at_01.38.37.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Screen_Shot_2014-10-26_at_01.38.37.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQZV3IBMDT%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T144614Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHx%2BIgfH0%2FRLQqbPD5vv6PNps92HY0yneL0kxkNwZHOyAiALrXRJqTvQQGm0xEkYGCB0kbPjUCCkzSeRztvcuetAYyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIM5FTPTB1nK4gXIBLuKtcDHmLbKhsWpyXKgWy1fAYOf0DZEqCEqF9ns7RwihS1bFM9%2BSDXYY0CmIqutWQhK5asoL8jbJZ39%2FJ2eai2SoxTlg3PhjMpNNSUfPFgauwX6vt%2FoeK9VnB1Hmqg6bCNA62qIJPnlTONluGngv604Y6CnYL9Se%2B%2BjgOpqhqmIOX9KlzGAoRM0Ci%2BrWGdELH8Q66bSHmapdLHPWMoGBEj%2BeruK3oCs%2BDaUQ1aE%2FEQ8R5PgqLM3Pq6DrZV9PlFixmkikk8SpDcsFEiT0Zw0gsy2qPz3z3BHAEuG64GguAhIs5FvYP7HbdpPv7rQz4QSDXgN3SIbVD0A4kcV1iNQpZyiw2rmdxuUWIk46d%2FT0u%2B7j9yAdfpDuPVKPDHJD35k0pB6VLe7RtlSwwvcDUa7LL6FJxvOPpupIMPSy51BJl9%2Bf8022a6pcy263zeRDGJjALAc6brW%2BvQoDUu%2FQP%2BdxwOLZvXCyyGJp2%2BK86jg8qU%2FLWZ4DVeR3bIO1n7Fw%2B53iFlBIMatC3ZSLlV1J7dSDCk74u6OWvql%2Brvb6q%2Bj8NHQK6luFckQV%2B9okMhTYuNniW3sHS8rjyNrrGhP8vMtxMzink9EL%2FmU0Oxusg2wmaXCDfIKpDDmspvZQv8MJ%2F%2FkIsGOqYBaz2hfRV48KDU0Mx0UomuXdEWK6oszm51EnI%2FeSepVmINgIWWggB7gENawN0rgfpMSIqQjB%2BpErtoDw1jNWaknZlAG9GLkCZ49lNHNirjr7iPk7LouunUzSZjaag8Yc19L8BAWjyLZnHXpqUZQRBSoqOcAoct3F46M7AzK2ewXHmh7aKY3cfAQTu9yVTJd2CDpuLtlyUDUa37BJ8%2F84puzgJS34jmeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=55d141da57bc5636225e35c48c3714ddaca82488c09aae154be999c4520ddc7f","file_size":221140,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-12-03T23:36:10.366Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-216313804.08683264,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":39,"voters":["sat0shi","sameerphad72","spam404","mattberg","dilawer01","realtess","0nlymohammed","r3y","fantam1","japz","and 29 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":148984,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report!
