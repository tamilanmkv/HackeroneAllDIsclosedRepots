I respect what ever is the bounty policy.\n\nBut I do not agree with the reasoning behind \"disabling tracking vectors and keeping websites working\". \nFor the following reasons:\n\n1.  This issue was not about \"Service workers\" but instead about \"Shared workers\" : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker\n\n2. Can you site some example where disabling \"Shared workers\" includes site breakage. In my experience, it should not break much, specially as compared to breakage one might observe with 3rd parties disabled. Shared workers can still function but double-keyed with origin.\n\n3. I reported the same issue with Chromium, which was fixed (My naive understanding is that Brave picks some portion from Chromium) so I guess this port is missing.  Issue: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=786187#c6\n\n4. I tested the same on other popular browsers:\n   a. Firefox\n   b. Chrome / Chromium\n   c. Opera\n   All with third party cookies disabled, the worker functionality works, but tracking is not possible.\nSo I think, Brave putting privacy first, should be able to do it as well.\n\nIn any case, request you to make this report public, and since it does not need to be a private issue, we can open a ticket on https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues/","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-04-02T21:15:56.030Z","updated_at":"2018-04-02T21:15:56.030Z","actor":{"username":"kmodi","cleared":false,"url":"/kmodi","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/164/034/95df7d59a39c078497891cefff825eaf86197a04_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2556549,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"I'm happy to make this public, and happy to work on this issue in public on our GitHub. Working in public is always preferable, where possible. I certainly agree that this is an issue we should work to fix. And indeed, double-keying cookies accessed by workers may well be the right fix. We do use a lot of code from Chromium, and are in the process of a big rewrite to use even more of Chromium rather than Muon, our security-focused Electron fork. If this is already fully resolved in Chromium then we probably just get that fix automatically. You can check our newer more-Chromium-based work at https://github.com/brave/brave-browser.
