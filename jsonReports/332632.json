Also note that this flaw seems to also be present in the \"Set out of office email response\" flow, albeit less critical.\n\n### Flow\nThe **SYSTEM PASSWORD RESET** flow is a 3-steps process:\n\n1. the staff member requests a SMS TOKEN using the first form\n2. the 6-digits SMS TOKEN is used in the second form\n3. the staff member can now set a new SYSTEM PASSWORD in the third form\n\n### Analysis and logic\nI was able to go through the process even after providing non-existing usernames and tokens by intercepting the **response** in BurpSuite and changing the status code from **400 Bad Request** to **200 OK** and the body from `\"status\":\"error\"` to `\"status\":\"ok\"`, allowing the AngularJS applet to follow through.\nI then noticed that the API endpoint for verifying the SMS TOKEN and changing the password where open and free of rate-limiting measures, allowing for a quick bruteforce of the 000000-999999 space. \nIt should be therefore possible to perform an account takeover on any staff member, provided the SMS TOKEN really is a 6-digits code\n\n### Theoretical POC\n1. adversary starts the SYSTEM PASSWORD RESET process for the target victim using a POST request to `/api/system/verification-codes` (ie: `{\"username\":\"admin\"}`). The backend generates a SMS TOKEN and sends it to the victim's phone. Meanwhile,\n2. adversary obtains the **securityCode** value for the victim by bruteforcing `/api/system/verification-codes/[0-9]{6}` before the victim can cancel the flow (threat scenario places the attack durin night time)\n3. adversary can now reset the SYSTEM PASSWORD by sending the complete POST request to `/api/system/email-account/password` (ie: `{\"password\":\"\u003cNEW PASSWORD\u003e\",\"code\":\"\u003cBRUTEFORCED SMS TOKEN\u003e\",\"securityCode\":\"\u003cRETRIEVED SECURITY CODE\u003e\"}`)\n\nStep #1 offers a ReCAPTCHA anti-CSRF token but it's not used anywhere in the flow, making the attack possible\n\nStep #2 is really a matter of resources. Being free of rate-limiting, the API endpoint will be quickly queried for all the possible token combinations in a matter of minutes using a multithreaded approach (ie: using BurpSuite's Intruder).\n\nAlbeit theoretical, the logic behind the threat scenario seems plausible. It might be worth investigating.\n\n### Recommended actions\nProperly implement the ReCAPTCHA and a strict ratelimiting on the API endpoints\n\n## Impact\n\nAn adversary might be able to takeover staff accounts, or set their \"out of office\" email replies.","bounty_amount":"200.0","formatted_bounty":"$200","weakness":{"id":92,"name":"Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-10-18T14:39:12.047Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-94090073.01025143,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":23,"voters":["europa","kapytein","sameerphad72","spam404","mik317","ali","emitrani","eveeez","an0nym0us","malcolmx","and 13 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":5853,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"Domain listed in the policy scope","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2563727,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the report, we will check it out.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-04-04T08:19:14.783Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T08:19:14.783Z","actor":{"username":"rvn","cleared":false,"url":"/rvn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/144/104/9f11d937232d6a42214b3bd66b367e56840de689_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"bohemia","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2564763,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"This has been confirmed as a legitimate issue.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-04-04T14:07:38.674Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T14:07:38.674Z","actor":{"username":"rvn","cleared":false,"url":"/rvn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/144/104/9f11d937232d6a42214b3bd66b367e56840de689_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"bohemia","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2564813,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"Bounty awarded.
