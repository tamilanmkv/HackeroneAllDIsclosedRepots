This is seen when a user tries to enter an invalid API token.\n\n**Description**\n\nIt was seen that after setting up phabricator integration in a program, when trying to escalate a report to phabricator, if the API token entered was invalid in terms of length/authenticity, the error message contains the entered API token. \n\nThis was seen when trying to escalate a report using a phabricator instance and previously used API token. \n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n1. Visit https://hackerone.com/*program name*/phabricator_integration\n1. Enter an instance URL\n1. Enter the API token incorrectly.\n1. Now navigate to any report you want to escalate.\n1. Click on Edit References.\n1. Click on \"Create phabricator task\"\n1. Error message will appear with API token.\n\n+ Invalid token error\n\n{F283480}\n\n\n+ Invalid length error\n\n{F283481}\n\nAbove image contains an API token that was entered incorrectly in terms of length. \n\nBoth of the above errors contain the API token that was entered incorrectly.\n\n**Fix**\n\n1. One thing to mention is that the integration page does not validate the API token lengths while entering. API token lengths should be checked on integration setting page itself.\n1. Validity of API token should also be checked while saving integration settings itself.\n\n## Impact\n\n1. API tokens are not normally displayed anywhere else after setting up the integration. Team members with limited permissions who normally have no access to such information can see the API tokens.\n1. Mistyped API token like the one below could easily reveal actual API tokens. The mistyped API tokens could be part of actual API tokens. \n\n{F283481}","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":82,"name":"Information Exposure Through an Error Message"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":283480,"file_name":"ph1.PNG","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/283/480/a62e8082d24587028f89f3f6b2dffb3c3d1f984f/ph1.PNG?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22ph1.PNG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ph1.PNG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQY53K44OC%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T144721Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQCU8ZTbZzS6KdrG%2BJrTZNy82bTqU%2FWXOWwT7y6tP8B6KAIgQozKTGEEU%2F70E9jK8ee9qFehhPTHAyr6tKNPFg0ipagqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDF24qMO4iM3lRhiKeSrXA3AD62arZ%2FR73I3OwVYKSQCLgGLmSdy1oHr3484T3%2BZNdRf9jASNKtWoD4ND1FsQM%2BH%2FxYbuyUfVW1RfHyrPNSyl31UWmh7%2FQLuSlKjidHFofUO6MlDrn8WL5H8Dklkc%2FODNXnwWhhBS4P4ETpaL0O2W1uk1mywZuHYi%2FHdUzHz3D04j6CIFX8koOXulelg3aywpppZ%2BEQtc5UJl3%2FFtSaZhFImaUXkZ%2BzfEI%2BbQZR9YL2QECzdM3wSFAU88f993HARvk3jnLnZu%2FeEflruySV3ucsnDUFOGStl4Z92w7SWYAu4eDkreiVsqtuAq5AUa5%2BxAlO8ntiuuW%2F1ub33RDrVP%2F1fK0GljO09wOd0GggTt7eJg%2FThXb0E0vNvuwPp1jdadEeVnZq2BNBCkROzc7bkLv3NE%2FYGkeq2tXA2h%2FEIK8ch9Mnp6UiGfyxWGAmVSXsYjBfrEAhj%2FOjyT96V663zm4TqRAN1sBiDSBG2V62BD69wu%2BKoIKDUGczZoq%2FV0i7T2Z94gjXG54fv8Q9pYpQYidhIS8cWbi1UAeyC7clfpue5hvais0Jt95MyKeSs9D4lwBmMR0UyOP2rP66bKUJXZxm09UaueyC8QE1RefPMEnNlod%2FEZhzCfjpGLBjqlAXGztZxISzkOSBi8ODZQNabZwzSDol%2BJUpM4q3e6PNJ%2FgMEC3ZQgjfp1kkwqPmzwlsAYYdaiUyY63ZSo5cIUxwTYMNXkbtuqxJrWDNMFnO8tISB8THjfP1XKNdJ7hpjx0Bx9mhmB9FifH5ih2c0AvGKyBC0fFcEdB0xLEnh5UcS8oUuRyx81oqTUXuBHWiT8%2B9GXMeEJa92HZXoXratnwKl2tc9yww%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=9c8023b2953c1147d84f930f94bd8f95d545a90078b1fae2853df8a8ba75e9ca","file_size":85629,"type":"image/png"},{"id":283481,"file_name":"ph2.PNG","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/283/481/d9e488d6bf2359c349836110ca0304b269c134b2/ph2.PNG?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22ph2.PNG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ph2.PNG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQY53K44OC%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T144722Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQCU8ZTbZzS6KdrG%2BJrTZNy82bTqU%2FWXOWwT7y6tP8B6KAIgQozKTGEEU%2F70E9jK8ee9qFehhPTHAyr6tKNPFg0ipagqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDF24qMO4iM3lRhiKeSrXA3AD62arZ%2FR73I3OwVYKSQCLgGLmSdy1oHr3484T3%2BZNdRf9jASNKtWoD4ND1FsQM%2BH%2FxYbuyUfVW1RfHyrPNSyl31UWmh7%2FQLuSlKjidHFofUO6MlDrn8WL5H8Dklkc%2FODNXnwWhhBS4P4ETpaL0O2W1uk1mywZuHYi%2FHdUzHz3D04j6CIFX8koOXulelg3aywpppZ%2BEQtc5UJl3%2FFtSaZhFImaUXkZ%2BzfEI%2BbQZR9YL2QECzdM3wSFAU88f993HARvk3jnLnZu%2FeEflruySV3ucsnDUFOGStl4Z92w7SWYAu4eDkreiVsqtuAq5AUa5%2BxAlO8ntiuuW%2F1ub33RDrVP%2F1fK0GljO09wOd0GggTt7eJg%2FThXb0E0vNvuwPp1jdadEeVnZq2BNBCkROzc7bkLv3NE%2FYGkeq2tXA2h%2FEIK8ch9Mnp6UiGfyxWGAmVSXsYjBfrEAhj%2FOjyT96V663zm4TqRAN1sBiDSBG2V62BD69wu%2BKoIKDUGczZoq%2FV0i7T2Z94gjXG54fv8Q9pYpQYidhIS8cWbi1UAeyC7clfpue5hvais0Jt95MyKeSs9D4lwBmMR0UyOP2rP66bKUJXZxm09UaueyC8QE1RefPMEnNlod%2FEZhzCfjpGLBjqlAXGztZxISzkOSBi8ODZQNabZwzSDol%2BJUpM4q3e6PNJ%2FgMEC3ZQgjfp1kkwqPmzwlsAYYdaiUyY63ZSo5cIUxwTYMNXkbtuqxJrWDNMFnO8tISB8THjfP1XKNdJ7hpjx0Bx9mhmB9FifH5ih2c0AvGKyBC0fFcEdB0xLEnh5UcS8oUuRyx81oqTUXuBHWiT8%2B9GXMeEJa92HZXoXratnwKl2tc9yww%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=9f1e3f716a84d679d84aea72302c86af5cbed682987cc23c0636b1fd4432aebd","file_size":59837,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-07-27T02:59:13.703Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-101303288.2988441,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":15,"voters":["ali","geeknik","eveeez","an0nym0us","apapedulimu","khizer47","bijan_xd","truwa","japz","d4rk_g1rl","and 5 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"none","score":0.0,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"high","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2582734,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Forgot to mention this:\n\nThe error message can appear if user misses even a single alphabet of API token.

There are no validations on the integration page currently. By this you can make sure two things mainly :\n\n1. Only users who have admin rights will see the API token, unlike otherwise where users with report only rights can also see while escalating.\n2. Also, because the API tokens are no where displayed elsewhere for reference, it would be better if admins are warned about errors, right at the time of creating the integration.
