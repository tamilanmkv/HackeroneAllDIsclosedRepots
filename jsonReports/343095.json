Thus, the risk exists that an attacker will intercept the clear-text communication between the browser and the server and he will steal the cookie of the user. If this is a session cookie, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to the victim's web session. \nRecommendation:I recommend reconfiguring the web server in order to set the flag(s) Secure to all sensitive cookies. \nReference:-https://blog.dareboost.com/en/2016/12/secure-cookies-secure-httponly-flags/.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe secure flag is an option that can be set by the application server when sending a new cookie to the user within an HTTP Response. The purpose of the secure flag is to prevent cookies from being observed by unauthorized parties due to the transmission of a the cookie in clear text.\nTo accomplish this goal, browsers which support the secure flag will only send cookies with the secure flag when the request is going to a HTTPS page. Said in another way, the browser will not send a cookie with the secure flag set over an unencrypted HTTP request.\nBy setting the secure flag, the browser will prevent the transmission of a cookie over an unencrypted channel.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":4,"voters":["xiaoyinl","kunal94","khizer47","dolph1n"],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":8869,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://git.edoverflow.com/","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2668410,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Hi @k1rt100f1c1al,\n\nExpoitability of this issue is so low that it does not warrant an immediate fix.
