For the benefit of @nismo, I will clarify my doubts here as well.\n\nI think the thing that I (and perhaps @nismo) are most confused about is the distinction between private and sandboxed programs. I understand from your program's policy that information disclosures that do not distinguish between these types of programs are considered out of scope. \n\nSeeing that the previous report #342978, in which both @nismo and I had filed duplicates on, made use of a similar property (in that case `whitelisted_hackers`) to identify if an external program was actually running a private program, what is the exact difference between that report and this report, _in terms of distinguishing between sandboxed and private programs_?\n\nBased on your explanation, let me try to see if what I understood is correct: \n\n1. Sandboxed programs cannot accept submissions from the general public, while \"private programs\" (in your terminology) refers to programs that _do_ accept submissions, regardless of whether the program is viewable (i.e. external program).\n2. The `whitelisted_hackers` field only applies to \"private programs\", since this count supposedly only counts invited researchers.\n3. Meanwhile, the absence of `FEATURE_GATED` from `i_cannot_create_jira_webhook_reasons` can show that a program exists under the handle, regardless if it is sandboxed or \"private\".\n\nTherefore, what you're saying is that:\n\n1. _There is no vulnerability_ if we can tell if an external program is running a program that hasn't been launched\n2. _There is a vulnerability_ if we can tell whether an external program is \"private\" or sandboxed, i.e. whether they are a paying customer\n\nI think the reason why we are confused is that we don't have any examples of what a sandboxed (and not \"private\") program looks like. In addition, in report #342978 you said (and I quote):\n\n\u003e this issue can be used to determine whether external programs in our Directory are running private programs\n\nThis led us to believe that there is indeed a vulnerability if we could tell if an external program was running a program under the handle, since we could already tell that some of them (notably ████, or companies with their own bug bounty programs like ██████ and █████████) would not have a private program in HackerOne. The findings in this report as well as my own duplicate in #349172 were based on this assumption.\n\nIt would be helpful if you could confirm/provide a precise definition of the four states of a program you are referring to, in order to avoid future invalid reports.\n\nThanks once again, and sorry for the long reply!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-05-09T04:07:49.593Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T23:53:26.059Z","actor":{"username":"irvinlim","cleared":false,"url":"/irvinlim","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/182/993/ef72d24864e65926f1e13ccd3aadc1ca1a0002b3_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2718151,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@jobert and @security\n\nI am surprised to see triaging but not accepting the report for the $2500 award saying its not eligible.\n\nPerhaps HackerONE Team can explain how the #342978 referring the  parameter \"whitelisted_hackers\" got triaged and awarded as MEDIUM RISK, since on that report  it is also uncertain to distinguish PRIVATE vs SANDBOXED programs as well, based on the parameter awarded.\n\n* For ex. ████ \"whitelisted_hackers\" count_total is 1. Does it mean it runs a PRIVATE program? Certainly NO\n\nNevertheless it got triaged and awarded, got a MEDIUM RISK and I filed a duplicate on that.\n\nMy POC in here has both of the parameters so you can distinguish and tell the difference. But my report here was set a risk of NONE?\n\nSorry to ask again, since I didn't get an answer and still wondering.\n\nDoes #342978 actually distinguish SANDBOX or PRIVATE as written in that report while rewarding? Or as I ask above is ██████████ running a PRIVATE based on that report? If in doubt then then I guess that my report here should be eligible as well, dont you think?\n\n@jobert I certainly hope you will reconsider the report to be eligible and equally risked to \"whitelisted_hackers\" impact, since I know and trust your professionalism and honesty in judging reports equally.\n\nPS: Thanks to the researcher who backed up my report for the  award eligibility.

Let me start by saying that we're not here to not pay you for your reports. However, let me elaborate on the situation: all your reports are claiming that you can determine whether an external program is also running a private program on HackerOne. I agree that this may be true in some cases, but there's no guarantee.\n\nAny company can claim an external program page on HackerOne. They can do this without running a program. When they've claimed a program page, they can maintain their policy in the Directory to make sure it's up to date with their own. It also means that the community can't contribute anymore to that page. When they've claimed the page, they can create a program in our demo environment. Within our demo environment, you can freely pick a product edition. Depending on which one they pick to poke around, you'll see the `FEATURE_GATED` error being returned. It may also mean that they're running a private program. Because of the number of different cases you can't guarantee that they are running a program. If your goal is to enumerate all the programs I don't see how this would get you any closer to your goal, because you could reach out to the company anyway (asking for invites isn't tolerated though).\n\nIt reveals about the same amount of information as signing in with `user@some-sso-enabled-domain.com` and getting redirected to a company's SSO provider or trying to sign up for a user with a company name and realizing it's already been taken (anyone could've taken this).

I should state that this was not obviously clear at first but you CAN select any program state you want in a sandboxed environment. I realized this after reading the long explanation. So I was able to select enterprise edition which removed the FEATURE_GATED response from my program ████  even when I queried from a non admin account. Which means anyone can create programs that also do not return the FEATURE-GATED response. \n\nHowever a sandboxed environment in basic edition can invite hackers as they want. Which means if I invite 5 of my friends whitelisted_hackers would show 5. I think you need both of the info disclosures to make sure someone is running a private program.
