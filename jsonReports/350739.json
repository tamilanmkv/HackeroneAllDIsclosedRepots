Logo, a partir disso enumerar programas privados no HackerOne.\n\nEm resumo o ataque consiste na criação de uma página maliciosa por um atacante, esta página, ao ser acessada pela vítima, irá disparar requisições ao HackerOne e de acordo com o tempo de resposta de cada requisição o atacante irá inferir se o programa já foi lançado ou não.\n\nExemplificando para facilitar o entendimento:\n\nA página https://hackerone.com/programa_privado (imagine que é um programa existente) pode ser acessada por um usuário nos seguintes casos:\n\n1. O programa é público (então qualquer usuário pode acessar).\n2. O programa é privado, o usuário foi convidado pelo programa e aceitou.\n3. O programa é privado, o usuário foi convidado pelo programa, mas não aceitou ou recusou ainda.\n4. O usuário é membro do programa (inclui programas lançados e sandboxados).\n\nNos outros casos (programa não existe, programa existe e é privado mas o usuário não foi convidado, usuário não é membro do programa), quando a página for acessada pelo usuário, ele irá se deparar com um erro.\n\nO endpoint https://hackerone.com/programa_privado/weakness segue as mesmas regras, e é usado no ataque por causa da resposta grande que ele retorna quando o usuário tem permissão para acessar a página (condições 1, 2, 3 ou 4), comparada com quando não tem.\n\nSabendo disso, se um usuário acessasse a página do atacante, e a resposta de uma requisição feita para https://hackerone.com/programa_privado/weakness fosse condizente com a resposta de um usuário que tem acesso ao programa, isso implicaria nas condições 2, 3 ou 4. A condição 1 pode ser facilmente descartada porque se o atacante acessasse https://hackerone.com/programa_privado veria que não é um programa público.\n\nPara descartar a condição 4, uma requisição seria feita para https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?subject=programa_privado e se o usuário tivesse permissão para acessar essa página, isso implicaria que ele é membro do programa, agora se ele não tivesse permissão, isso implicaria que a condição 2 ou 3 é verdadeira, e em qualquer uma delas, você descobre que o programa já foi lançado e é privado.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-05-17T00:18:14.975Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T00:18:14.975Z","actor":{"username":"herrera","cleared":true,"url":"/herrera","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/135/135/6dcad97a628cf9a89cc5394e378b04f49f3bb5b8_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2754637,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@herrera \n\nEntendi, basicamente você estaria utilizando a combinação das duas requisições para determinar a existência do programa e se ele é privado/sandboxed.\n\nRequisição 1 - https://hackerone.com/programa_privado/weakness confirma a existência ou não do programa\nRequisição 2 - https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?subject=programa_privado informa se o usuário é ou não membro do programa.\n\nCaso as 2 sejam positivas, não seria possível diferenciar se o programa é privado ou sandboxed, mas caso a Req 1 seja positiva E a Req 2 seja negativa, seria possível inferir que o programa existe e o usuário não é membro do programa.\n\nExistem alguns falsos positivos que poderiam ocorrer aí no meio, mas me deixe levantar isso com a equipe e ver o que eles acham.\n\nDe toda forma, conforme informado pelo Jobert, isso já foi reportado várias vezes, a última vez na semana passada, e até então é um risco que a H1 decidiu assumir.\n\nAbraços!\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-05-17T01:07:47.692Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T01:07:47.692Z","actor":{"username":"glassofbeer","cleared":false,"url":"/glassofbeer","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/166/997/bf60ed9bb749786ae3f68f25703bf0528699cda7_original.JPG/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":true,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":true},{"id":2754649,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@glassofbeer - É isso mesmo.
