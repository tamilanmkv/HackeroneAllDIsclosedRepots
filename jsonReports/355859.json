Make reservation in the background upon victim's click. He gains email/mobile of the victim account.\n#==\u003e(2) He may reserve a table of some business that charges upon cancellation and the victim may face monetary loss. \n#==\u003e(3) He may target a business and  try to restrict all the genuine bookings. It would be possible to do so by booking all table slots of different timings from all the different visitors that are coming to his malicious but genuine looking website.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability depends on the number of visitors attacker might be able to bring to his website. This is not a very big deal in the presence of huge social media websites nowadays. Or he may paste link to his website somewhere on yelp (review/about/talk etc sections) platform itself so as to bring authenticated yelp users to his website.\n\n## Impact\n\nWhile the  overall risk may only be a medium rating; the impact is high as the vulnerability affects both the yelp users and also business owners\n\n#The vulnerability impacts the victim in the following ways:\n==\u003e1.) Loss of Confidentiality: Private info such as Email/phone is disclosed\n==\u003e 2.) Unauthorized Reservations from User Account: This certainly is not wanted by any user.\n==\u003e 3.) Monetary loss upon Cancellation of reservation: Some businesses say they would charge upon \ncancellation of reservation.\n==\u003e 4.) Apart from this client's trust on Yelp platform is also lost.\n\n#The vulnerability impacts the business owners in the following ways:\n==\u003e1.) Fake reservations may restrict genuine reservations:\nSuch Fake reservations may restrict genuine users from booking tables. And on the other end the business owners have no way to distinguish between fake and genuine ones.\nThis leads to customer/monetary loss to business owners itself.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control -
