I agree with you that we can't exploit this vulnerability for a total unknown person. Anyhow this vulnerability can easily be exploited if we know a colleague, friend, known person who's a reporter on hackerone. What an attacker would do if someone is attacker's friend/colleague/known person, an attacker would ask just for the report id i do agree that an unknown person won't give any of his report id but yes if an attacker asks for report id from their colleague/friend or a known person there are about 60-70% chances that they'll give report id to the attacker what attacker does for getting report id is depends on attacker, as they trust hackerone and know that there is no way that an attacker would be able to get any type of information about report so they might give it to attacker. As attacker already know them so of-course attacker will have their hackerone username as they were attacker's friend/colleague/known person because we just need a username as you've said that `one of our support representatives made a judgement call based on the username that was shown in the ticket. There's an account associated with both email addresses @ amans and @ amans1` so attacker will make a account with similar username and send an email to support@hackerone.com impersonating the real reporter. I instantly made a report after getting the disclosure date. An attacker might ask for more information about report and may ask to do some actions on behalf of the real reporter as attacker is impersonating the real reporter.\nSo i believe this should be considered as a `Medium vulnerability` as attack is not that much complex and we're getting a most secret information easily that is about a report which is not even disclosed. \n\nEven thou @amans1 account was disabled so hackerone support team didn't even check the account status as well.\n\nThanks","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-05-24T07:52:18.488Z","updated_at":"2018-05-24T07:57:47.105Z","actor":{"username":"amans","cleared":false,"url":"/amans","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/260/086/7e52a47867e42c3a048e38f03c0e95c05b6d05a4_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2789983,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I've exams going on these days and i had no laptop available that time when i was writing this report so i made this report from cellphone that's why i couldn't write much about this issue .\n\nAttacker just need to have two things to exploit this issue Report ID and Username of the Reporter and i've explained all in the last comment.\n\nWe can search users on hackerone with their full name also, even thou we don't have a username of that reporter just have/know the real name of reporter and a report id we can search that user on hackerone with their real name and mostly people use their real name on hackerone.

Its not about the `state` its about all the information that a Support team can provide to the user. I'm impersonating someone and support has confirmed that's a real user not attacker like they gave me information about the state of the report that isn't even disclosed so can't i ask for more information from support as they're thinking that's real user? I thought that information about the state of undisclosed report from support would be okay as a PoC for you to analyze the impact but unfortunately you're sticked to the `state` of report.
