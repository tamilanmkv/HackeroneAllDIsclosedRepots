I believe a fix for this should now be deployed, if you'd like to verify.\n\nDetails on the fix: For compatibility reasons, we're still accepting the `example_api_url` and `contact_url` options in this API, but we're now sanitizing these URLs to ensure they only point to known domains that are registered and managed within our system. Longer term, we may look to remove these options altogether from the API and provide admins a different way for managing these custom URLs, but I believe the current solution of sanitizing the domains against our known list should also mitigate this.\n\nYou can view the code changes involved in this fix here: https://github.com/NREL/api-umbrella/commit/89f7ec277fcca795932a1bfb2116913d5ec84a10\n\nLet us know if you have any questions or feedback, and thanks again for reporting the issue and your patience!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-11-02T02:40:03.025Z","updated_at":"2018-11-02T02:40:03.025Z","actor":{"username":"gui","cleared":false,"url":"/gui","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/186/433/c9255c84a11a587c84abe19123c276672b526bc1_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gsa_bbp","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3573596,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @gui,\nI can see the changes in the code changes and appreciate your action for resolve.
