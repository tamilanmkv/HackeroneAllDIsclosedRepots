The user logins to a shared computer (office, library, cafe)\n2. Left the account open.\n3. Intruder came and try to delete the users account\n4. Intruder can easily delete the account because the system did not protect it by asking the password to validate that the person deleting the account is the real user.","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":3,"voters":["0x08","1039250342","gideon_xd"],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":8926,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.liberapay.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2835773,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"We appreciate the information and will consider this in the future, but are not taking immediate action at this time as a result of this report and not tracking this as a security issue.
