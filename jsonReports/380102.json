These protections are per-default enabled since approximately 10 years in Visual Studio and are very important because they make exploitation a lot harder (or even make some vulnerabilities not exploitable).\n\nPlease note: The Nextcloud code was updated on 4 September 2017 to enable ASLR and DEP. Here is the commit:\nhttps://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/commit/6f270a364895d7f1f0a424c8347cd2913971cca4#diff-95e351a3805a1dafa85bf20b81d086e6\n\nHowever, the current NextCloud Client (version 2.3.3.1) from 20 November 2017 from revision 57bc79 still doesn't have ASLR and DEP enabled. Here is the revision (where ASLR/DEP is also not enabled in the CMakeLists.txt file:\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/client/commit/57bc7918d7b0650c116f3512787f7677d4e5ab17\n\n\nAttached is a detailed description of the issue.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker has to find an additional vulnerability to exploit the missing memory corruption protections. For example, an attacker can search for a buffer overflow, use-after-free, type-confusion, ... vulnerability in the network communication and send a malicious payload / file from his Nextcloud server.\nThis vulnerability must not exist in the Nextcloud source code, for example, vulnerabilities in QT or other third-party libraries can also be used. For example, the current Nextcloud version uses QT 5.6.2 which was released on 11-Oct-2016. On 19-Oct-2016 a heap buffer overflow was found in QJsonDocument: https://www.peter.hartmann.tk/single-post/2016/11/29/Fuzzing-Qt-with-libFuzzer","bounty_amount":"50.0","formatted_bounty":"$50","weakness":{"id":2,"name":"Memory Corruption - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":318880,"file_name":"Nextcloud_MissingProtections.docx","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/318/880/03383f7413583a6ef84dbcb0071d947a90c63fcd/Nextcloud_MissingProtections.docx?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Nextcloud_MissingProtections.docx%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Nextcloud_MissingProtections.docx\u0026response-content-type=application%2Fvnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQY53K44OC%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T145257Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQCU8ZTbZzS6KdrG%2BJrTZNy82bTqU%2FWXOWwT7y6tP8B6KAIgQozKTGEEU%2F70E9jK8ee9qFehhPTHAyr6tKNPFg0ipagqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDF24qMO4iM3lRhiKeSrXA3AD62arZ%2FR73I3OwVYKSQCLgGLmSdy1oHr3484T3%2BZNdRf9jASNKtWoD4ND1FsQM%2BH%2FxYbuyUfVW1RfHyrPNSyl31UWmh7%2FQLuSlKjidHFofUO6MlDrn8WL5H8Dklkc%2FODNXnwWhhBS4P4ETpaL0O2W1uk1mywZuHYi%2FHdUzHz3D04j6CIFX8koOXulelg3aywpppZ%2BEQtc5UJl3%2FFtSaZhFImaUXkZ%2BzfEI%2BbQZR9YL2QECzdM3wSFAU88f993HARvk3jnLnZu%2FeEflruySV3ucsnDUFOGStl4Z92w7SWYAu4eDkreiVsqtuAq5AUa5%2BxAlO8ntiuuW%2F1ub33RDrVP%2F1fK0GljO09wOd0GggTt7eJg%2FThXb0E0vNvuwPp1jdadEeVnZq2BNBCkROzc7bkLv3NE%2FYGkeq2tXA2h%2FEIK8ch9Mnp6UiGfyxWGAmVSXsYjBfrEAhj%2FOjyT96V663zm4TqRAN1sBiDSBG2V62BD69wu%2BKoIKDUGczZoq%2FV0i7T2Z94gjXG54fv8Q9pYpQYidhIS8cWbi1UAeyC7clfpue5hvais0Jt95MyKeSs9D4lwBmMR0UyOP2rP66bKUJXZxm09UaueyC8QE1RefPMEnNlod%2FEZhzCfjpGLBjqlAXGztZxISzkOSBi8ODZQNabZwzSDol%2BJUpM4q3e6PNJ%2FgMEC3ZQgjfp1kkwqPmzwlsAYYdaiUyY63ZSo5cIUxwTYMNXkbtuqxJrWDNMFnO8tISB8THjfP1XKNdJ7hpjx0Bx9mhmB9FifH5ih2c0AvGKyBC0fFcEdB0xLEnh5UcS8oUuRyx81oqTUXuBHWiT8%2B9GXMeEJa92HZXoXratnwKl2tc9yww%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=f2f889e7e5de48e9fbc893c2459e5a0e4dbad82d340cd54f628d808aecc6a733","file_size":87182,"type":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-09-04T08:55:07.808Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-34754269.22620476,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":2,"voters":["b69fb2ebda43240ece9dbeb","rio2001vino"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":4.7,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"local","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"none","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":77,"asset_type":"DOWNLOADABLE_EXECUTABLES","asset_identifier":"Desktop Client","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3023711,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us!\n\nOur security team will take a look at this issue as soon as possible.
