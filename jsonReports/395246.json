Intercept an authenticated request on █████████ containing an Authorization header.\n2. Replace the url with `█████████`. Observe that the id in the url can be incremented/decremented to view recently generated OMPFs.\n3. Upon submitting the request, the user's full ███████ form JSON response will be sent.\n\n## Impact\n\nAccess to ████ is possible through either a Department of Defense Self-Service logon, CAC card, or █████████password. Thus, a compromise of a single account on any of these systems would allow for unrestricted access to all ████ forms.\n\nThe ████ form includes the following\n- PII such as SSN, DoB, addresses, etc\n- Personal remarks\n- Other fields related to security clearances, education, maritial status, etc","weakness":{"id":55,"name":"Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":17,"voters":["spam404","eveeez","dastan_9408","trainr3kt","bb00x","cryptographer","armansameer","arshad2104","sinswriter","jillianhax","and 7 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3196102,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
