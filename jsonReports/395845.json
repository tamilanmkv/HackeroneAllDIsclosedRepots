For the sake of completeness, I found this issue when testing a real world app.\n\nThis also affects [this npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url). \nThe WHATWG API handles this particular case well.\n\nIn might be a good idea to mention in the documentation that URL parsing shouldn't be relied on in security relevant context. Exact string matching or similarly simple concepts should be always preferred.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis can be dangerous if used in security relevant access controls as follows:\n\n```js\nlet parsedUrl = UrlHelper.parse(url); // url = javAscript:alert(1);a='@localhost/'\nif (parsedUrl.hostname === 'localhost') { // parsedUrl.hostname = localhost\n  return true; // and do something like window.location = url \n}\n```\n\nAlthough being a bad practice, developers will write this code and will introduce bypassable access controls. Given that the bypass works only with `javascript:` URIs this will likely lead to XSS in most cases.","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-02-13T23:54:32.425Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-52326061.90574949,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":11,"voters":["jonathanbouman","bl4de","sameerphad72","mik317","johndoe1492","poulfaded","speedman","varunjha089","ryanlevi","goldenninja","and 1 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":6.1,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":666,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3204802,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @bayotop thanks for submitting this report.
