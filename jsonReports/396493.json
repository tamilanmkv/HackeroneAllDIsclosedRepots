The first issue is unfixed for over a year now, #252908, the second issue originates in a 3rd party module called prettyPhoto. \n\n**Description:**\n\nVisiting the following link results in a JavaScript alert (use Firefox or Edge, Chrome's XSS Auditor blocks this particular payload):\n\n`https://www.starbucks.co.uk/shop/card/egift/thank-you/anything%2522onclick=%2522confirm(document.domain)#!\\'\\,\\*\\,/1`\n\nThis is possible because:\n\n1. there is a seemingly harmless HTML attribute injection into a `\u003clink rel=\"canonical\"\u003e` element (unfixed for over a year, see #252908) and\n2. the prettyPhoto JavaScript module allows to trigger the `click` event on any existing HTML element.\n\nThe following is done by prettyPhoto in https://www.starbucks.com/static/resource/shop_js/676938998_en-US:\n\n```js\nfunction d() {\n  url = location.href;\n  hashtag = (url.indexOf(\"#!\") != -1) ? decodeURI(url.substring(url.indexOf(\"#!\") + 2, url.length)) : false;\n  return hashtag\n}\n\nhashIndex = d();\nhashRel = hashIndex;\nhashIndex = hashIndex.substring(hashIndex.indexOf(\"/\") + 1, hashIndex.length - 1);\nhashRel = hashRel.substring(0, hashRel.indexOf(\"/\"));\nhashIndex = parseInt(hashIndex);\nhashRel = hashRel.replace(/([ #;\u0026,.+*~\\':\"!^$[\\]()=\u003e|\\/])/g, \"\\\\$1\");\nsetTimeout(function() {\n  b(\"a[rel^='\" + hashRel + \"']:eq(\" + hashIndex + \")\").trigger(\"click\")\n}, 50)\n```\n\nNotice how the user-controlled `hashRel` variable is [sanitized to prevent DOM XSS](https://www.saotn.org/prettyphoto-dom-based-xss/#how-to-fix-prettyphoto-dom-based-xss) in a quite obscure manner. It only works because it prefixes `=` with a `\\` ruining all standard DOM XSS payloads known to me. Also notice that `\\` is **not** escaped which means that it's possible to inject arbitrary valid jQuery selectors.\n\nCombining these two issues makes it possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript, by injecting an `onclick` HTML attribute into the `\u003clink rel=\"canonical\"\u003e` element and triggering it via the prettyPhoto JavaScript module by setting `hashRel` to `\\'\\,\\*\\,`. Due to the used jQuery version and it's lax parsing the following triggers the `click` event on all existing elements:\n\n```js\n$(\"a[rel^='\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\,\\\\\\\\*\\\\\\\\,']:eq(NaN)\").trigger(\"click\")\n```\n\n**Steps To Reproduce:**\n\nTested on latest Firefox and Edge:\n\n1. `https://www.starbucks.co.uk/shop/card/egift/thank-you/anything%2522onclick=%2522confirm(document.domain)#!\\'\\,\\*\\,/1`\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nRegarding the HTML attribute injection I suggested a fix in #252908. Regarding prettyPhoto, I don't believe it's actively maintained anymore so a customization will be necessary in my opinion. White-listing allowed characters in `hashRel` is the way to go with something like `\\w+`.\n\n## Impact\n\nAttackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victims' browsing context by tricking them into visiting an URL under the attackers' control. I believe you are aware of the dangers of XSS, but I am more then happy to show an actual exploit if needed.","bounty_amount":"250.0","formatted_bounty":"$250","weakness":{"id":61,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-06-21T13:39:52.101Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-41217347.25242699,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":11,"voters":["wh0ru","e4366eolywrgpidfbio","brahim_boufakri01","ali","leonishan","d4rkm4tter","potatosalad420","user923413253","mideno","komic_sans","and 1 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":13017,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"www.starbucks.co.uk","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3213734,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @bayotop,\n\nThank you for your submission.
