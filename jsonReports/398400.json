The directory contains a ~40GB large bzipped file called: ██████prodmysql.20161021.tar.bz2\n\nI don't want to go further and actually access that data, but based on what data you appear to store in your application this backup could contain:\n\n- email addresses;\n- (hashed) passwords;\n- social security numbers;\n- and/or credit card numbers;\n- and/or bank account numbers;\n- and/or address information.\n\nSince ██████ is using the ██████ API I expect W9 tax form data to be stored here as well.
