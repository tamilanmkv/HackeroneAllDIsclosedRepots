Since this is obviously not desirable, WordPress added meta capabilities. This allows to restrict Shop managers to not simply assign themselves Admin privileges.\n\nWooCommerce implements these restrictions the following way:\n\n```\n/**\n * Modify capabilities to prevent non-admin users editing admin users.\n *\n * $args[0] will be the user being edited in this case.\n *\n * @param  array  $caps    Array of caps.\n * @param  string $cap     Name of the cap we are checking.\n * @param  int    $user_id ID of the user being checked against.\n * @param  array  $args    Arguments.\n * @return array\n */\nfunction wc_modify_map_meta_cap( $caps, $cap, $user_id, $args ) {\n\tswitch ( $cap ) {\n\t\tcase 'edit_user':\n\t\tcase 'remove_user':\n\t\tcase 'promote_user':\n\t\tcase 'delete_user':\n\t\t\tif ( ! isset( $args[0] ) || $args[0] === $user_id ) {\n\t\t\t\tbreak;\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\tif ( user_can( $args[0], 'administrator' ) \u0026\u0026 ! current_user_can( 'administrator' ) ) {\n\t\t\t\t\t$caps[] = 'do_not_allow';\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n\treturn $caps;\n}\nadd_filter( 'map_meta_cap', 'wc_modify_map_meta_cap', 10, 4 );\n```\n\nWhenever any capability related to users is in question, WooCommerce disallows it if the target for the modification is an admin. \n\nHowever, this \"blacklist\" kind of approach is insufficient. The consequence is that a Shop manager can modify any user and can assign any user role that is not admin.\n\nThis means that if I were to hack a Shopmanager account, who does NOT posses the \"unfiltered_html\" capability, I can simply assign the user role editor, which does have the ability to post JavaScript code, to a random user or customer, change their password, log in and then get a Stored XSS working and hack the admin.\n\nAlso, if there are any other custom user roles registered on a Wordpress installation, I can also assign those to me.\n\nFor example, the Plugin https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/backwpup/ registers the user type BackWpUp Admin, a user who can create and download backups of the WordPress installation.\n\n\nProof of Concept:\n\nSimply login as a Shop manager, set the user role of a random user (e.g. a customer) to editor, change their password and then log into WordPress as that user. Then create a Post with your JavaScript Payload.\n\n## Impact\n\nSince Stored XSS is a very reliable way to escalate your privileges to Admin and this is occurs in every WooCommerce installation, I marked this as a high impact.","bounty_amount":"350.0","formatted_bounty":"$350","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege Escalation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-12-19T14:24:52.439Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-57198693.79058742,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":26,"voters":["foobar7","mashoud1122","sameerphad72","ali","realtess","bcobain23","t4ym","cryptographer","knoxpro","0x08","and 16 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3276244,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the report, I've forwarded it on to the WC team for review.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-31T17:34:26.083Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T17:34:26.083Z","actor":{"username":"vortfu","cleared":false,"url":"/vortfu","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/982/1ef285fb263d30f189dc6a8038e1d5c46086e9d9_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"automattic","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3321356,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi Simon,\n\nThanks for the report.
