This is a problem because it is a get request and I can try a bunch of ID's to randomly delete photos that don't belong to me or try to find a way to leak this ID from store page to do targeted deletes. \n\nI believe if you try to delete multiple photos there will be more ids in the request so that would allow to expand the attack by trying a lot of ids at once.\n\n**Platform(s) Affected:** [website]\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n\n  1. Get 2 stores.\n  2. With store 1 navigate to https://www.zomato.com/clients/manage_photos.php\n  3. Start to delete a photo and capture the request that looks like :\n\n```\nGET /php/client_manage_handler?███\u0026case=remove-active-photo HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.zomato.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nReferer: https://www.zomato.com/\nX-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest\nCookie: _ga=GA1.2.2082511252.1535917423; _gid=GA1.2.1587734047.1535917423; PHPSESSID=4821c7caf69f3253db3be3d4c42a15b7b04d223a; fbcity=283; zl=en; fbtrack=a09417c27b7e98b4b3f2ad8357ef3903; __utmx=141625785.FQnzc5UZQdSMS6ggKyLrqQ$0:NaN; __utmxx=141625785.FQnzc5UZQdSMS6ggKyLrqQ$0:1535944804:8035200; dpr=2; cto_lwid=82057293-9985-419b-a25b-4d8b6d89951b; G_ENABLED_IDPS=google; zhli=1; squeeze=cd186e1f53eee0d94e51ef00c9d4eb25; orange=2769113; al=1; session_id=null\nConnection: close\nX-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1\n\n```\n\n4 . Save the photo_ids parameter\n5 . Go to your second restaurant account and capture the same request with a different res_id and cookies\n6 . Replace the `photo_ids` with the id from step 4 and send request.\n7 . Observe the photo is deleted.\n\n## Impact\n\nBy using targeted or blind attacks it is possible to delete photos that don't belong to a restaurant because of this IDOR. My leading theory is that currently you are checking that the logged in user has permissions on the res_id in the request but not verifying that the res_id owns that photograph. There should be an additional check to ensure that the photo_id belongs to that restaurant before deleting it.\n\nRegards,\nEray","bounty_amount":"600.0","formatted_bounty":"$600","weakness":{"id":55,"name":"Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":49,"voters":["libcontainer","sameerphad72","spam404","miguel_santareno","mik317","flashdisk","ali","emitrani","aryan2808","generaleg","and 39 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":383,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.zomato.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3286156,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"POC:\n\n{F341857}","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-09-03T16:45:24.790Z","updated_at":"2018-09-03T16:45:24.790Z","actor":{"username":"emitrani","cleared":true,"url":"/emitrani","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/206/181/54e8d7444534dbe32a21bd75c87febb777a18496_original.PNG/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"attachments":[{"id":341857,"filename":"proof.JPG","type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/341/857/b4979640c930d4180787b1963665149d0f361784/proof.JPG?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22proof.JPG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27proof.JPG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ4IEPVQO5%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T145639Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIEfiwE8ABftQ4ZDSo2PcCdmgWGJAVhZBcjrVILPjej50AiACAJuLWZpiOUokpZpZYio1aaS1zedU6yBiP02ueFvn1iqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMwnKCmy9PUlqhlDykKtcDeye%2FigxH7oQuBLWPNAddVUxCetP%2B6VM%2FIfdoNEAf8dePeEZ6nfGVUDz0owpAQ8YnLRTgfKqbZIg9uvHiJY%2F4BbcoCSwwJdRGPldLb3Y3WlPcJ1JvXUEefleLwhstFskHZ2cPwg1VDGmKUpYSrXj0yczI934c5Lp8FHGi7k73DEu%2FAkrDbRnSZHG42WaaqPNNWImCdPeTEmq3NWpEt8cesOA6Xa4VqYMRs9drBzvQOySUd6OOKhFszrFCIooeL9FH3tfL1jRUt27tojJhfuYEL1%2BXkCSnEkXAKcWclEQwC3FfnY0XhghLZDzab25hU%2Bd2h1mXTSBw8U0KUeuS7BYp2gJWFyuMnua0PPwpsnfW%2B9HdmkGFEZMkcwfZlh9E6l1XmyYfjTKzbK4akQ37CPeaxglSuydRq%2BOr7eoa4bJwD8SbBbqyaFHvzfbmsQAD6vBhy3a3VJ%2FRjznM9l%2FDW%2BnlGoCNLaIcQRZvZ0zDR6x%2ByF%2BOA4LXd0zzf8we7BSGFKyQfoRnsOQpRday7KSiYLmMmNfRdBrUHLRHvgeo%2BpRsKlDHGprEYxVC9m%2FkU3USyz305DDgoYfE7CyGX%2FKauSdBx1ZrMRAhyMPdXtfyvzVr4uFs8EB9pzBTMM%2F%2FkIsGOqYBpHeiPK1x0yJBNNgdNDNHwOZb44D7QldQoMShvupPsVW7xgZ9egfooN5Hr7L7zQT0se6VW6MDEHSuh790gIEL3N2l3o4i8vRIQjRoeoSklFrZONuWaRaLdV2EJtaDDZ%2BwBg0kYTnQOYCaI2vJ3EB7BWjw1JRVBpZH6NvHFfING%2B%2Bhp9nGXAhqXdBxPezBeHqUbpMsZkRZrmnH1UVt5up6rjaXPnhY6Q%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=e12bf585dd858402ab6c7540564a0d0413a6eed3e538b469d4cb95de11841e1f"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"zomato","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3286175,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi @emitrani,\n\nThank you for your submission.
