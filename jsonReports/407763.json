(In other words, it can not be viewed by who are not project members.)\nIn also [GitLab Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/public_access/public_access.html), it is mentioned as follows:\n\u003e Private projects can only be cloned and viewed by project members, ...\n\nHowever, due to inadequate cache control on the most of pages related to Private projects, an attacker may view these contents using the 'Back' button in browser.\nIn addition, users without logging in can also exploit this problem.\n\nNote: This issue supports all modern browsers.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n1. Sign in to GitLab.\n2. Click the \"[+]\" icon.\n3. Click \"New Project\".\n4. Fill out \"Project name\" form with \"PoC\".\n5. Check the check box of \"Private\".\n6. Click \"Create project\" button.\n7. Sign out from Gitlab.\n8. Hit the \"Back\" button in browser.\n\nResult: The content of the private project \"PoC\" is displayed without logging in.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis issue leads to information leakage.\nCache control is inadequate on the most pages related to Private projects.\nTherefore, almost all contents of Private project may leak.\n\nAlthough the exploitation needs physical access to the victim's PC, It is not very difficult to access someone's PC in the following scenes:\n- Office scenario\n- Laptop case\n\nThe examples of critical information that may leak are as follows:\n- List of file names\n- Source code\n- Commit log\n- Issues\n- Contents of the wiki\n\nNote: The official document specifies that they will not be viewed by unauthorized users.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-01-02T19:56:21.560Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-87505233.23780657,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":22,"voters":["kapytein","bl4de","sameerphad72","ali","tulswani","dudez","geeknik","khizer47","kiraak-boy","cyberunit","and 12 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":4.6,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"physical","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3324249,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @8ayac  ,\n\nThank you for submitting this report.
