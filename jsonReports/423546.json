This also bypasses any maximum checkout amount that a store can set.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. As a Wholesale owner, ensure that a customer is disallowed from immediately checking out at https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin/apps/wholesale/admin/shops/x/accounts.\n  1. As the customer, visit the Wholesale shop and fill your cart with products.\n  1. Observe that the UI forces the user to submit a purchase order:\n\n    {F360285}\n\n  1. To bypass this restriction, intercept the request to `PUT /purchase_orders/submit` to submit the purchase order and change the url to `/purchase_orders/update_checkout`.\n  1. Observe that executing the request will allow the customer to proceed through the checkout flow and place the order:\n\n{F360296}\n\n## Impact\n\nThis allows a customer to bypass manual approval restrictions for a Wholesale store and immediately check out.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":8,"voters":["drsniper","ali","cr4xerbik4sh","pwnie","cryptographer","shopify-peteryaworski","417c","noobhax"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":5.3,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":37198,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"Shopify Developed Apps","max_severity":"medium"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3476877,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @cablej,\nthanks for the report!
