We've proactively reached out to the customer to explain what happened. In parallel, we removed non-US persons from the program, with one exception due to a pending submission. The customer has acknowledged the issue and has asked us to also remove the remaining person from the program, which we've done.\n\nThis problem originates from the fact that our invitation algorithm doesn't take geo restrictions into account. The program had been paused for some time and when we continued their submissions, a human error caused us to resume automatic invites for the program. Due to the lack of geo restrictions, people outside of the US were invited to the program. Because there are a very limited number of customers with these restrictions we decided not to prioritize building this into the product just yet.\n\nWe've scheduled a retrospective with engineering, our customer success team, and our general counsel to see how we can avoid problems like this going forward. In the interim, we've notified the team to review custom restrictions before continuing submissions for a program and when manually inviting people to the program.\n\nWe've looked at other programs that had similar restrictions and determined that there were no other programs where we made a similar mistake.\n\nThanks again for for diligence, it is much appreciated!
