It would not be particularly difficult to generate enough of these requests to tie up the majority of web serving resources for a typical Rails application.\n\nThis vulnerability has also been separately disclosed to rack-core mailing list by me.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\nI've created a script that can be run here against any Rack-based application: https://gist.github.com/bjeanes/63580e27c197885d4b07160fae132108\n\nBy default it generates a request body with 10,000 parts which, in my testing, was enough to cause GitHub API to take between 15-25 seconds to service the request once the request transfer had completed.\n\n## Addendum\n\nSome benchmarking of Rack is included here, which was also sent to rack-core:\n\n```\nN = number of parts, \nboundary used is as generated by Chrome, but larger boundaries cause\nhigher impact\n\nRehearsal --------------------------------------------\nN: 1       0.032670   0.006635   0.039305 (  0.044159)\nN: 100     0.008245   0.001319   0.009564 (  0.009971)\nN: 1000    0.149332   0.079087   0.228419 (  0.255769)\nN: 2000    0.398711   0.276931   0.675642 (  0.691356)\nN: 5000    2.254126   1.569181   3.823307 (  3.871649)\nN: 10000   7.134949   4.350681  11.485630 ( 12.083888)\nN: 20000  15.946187  10.491861  26.438048 ( 28.684177)\n---------------------------------- total: 42.699915sec\n\n               user     system      total        real\nN: 1       0.000372   0.000003   0.000375 (  0.000371)\nN: 100     0.004889   0.000021   0.004910 (  0.004977)\nN: 1000    0.117571   0.015548   0.133119 (  0.192915)\nN: 2000    0.468934   0.309703   0.778637 (  0.870675)\nN: 5000    2.086055   1.482317   3.568372 (  3.830543)\nN: 10000   7.110589   4.488229  11.598818 ( 12.110710)\nN: 20000  14.559701   9.948678  24.508379 ( 25.537332)\n```\n\nThis is not technically in the Rails codebase, but it is in a non-optional dependency of every Rails application.

Attack can be constructed with just a HTML web form, making it literally click-button easy. That it can be generated from a form also has potential implications when combined with XSS or some other mechanism where an attacker could cause arbitrary user agents en masse to send such requests.","bounty_amount":"1500.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,500","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-12-05T21:46:09.452Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-89918016.20904335,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":17,"voters":["bjeanes","bl4de","sameerphad72","leetboi","ali","geeknik","eveeez","an0nym0us","peeper35","khizer47","and 7 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":5.3,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"none","availability":"low"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":160,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/rails/rails","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3564133,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey Bo!\n\nThanks for jumping through the extra reporting hoops!\n\nIf it's not reproducible on master, I think this is https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1288 -- which has its own issues, now being addressed by https://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1309.\n\nDoes that sound plausible to you?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-31T15:54:22.308Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T15:54:22.308Z","actor":{"username":"matthewd","cleared":false,"url":"/matthewd","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/011/558/5df350e99e2e86f74de4e3bf90de8880ac877b25_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3565758,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I mentioned this on the mailing list, but I was able to bisect the problem to this commit: \nhttps://github.com/rack/rack/pull/1192/commits/ee0174822f9c4e939bd810c3e906554a7137973d\n\nThe changes on master seem too big to backport, so I'd prefer if we just revert this commit on the 2-0-stable branch.\n\nThoughts?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-31T18:28:04.724Z","updated_at":"2018-10-31T18:28:04.724Z","actor":{"username":"tenderlove","cleared":false,"url":"/tenderlove","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/318/60d828744b5d16813ecbf975fdc453dc4a933f4f_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3566177,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @matthewd and @tenderlove that all makes total sense. \n\n@tenderlove reverting ee0174822 will mean that https://github.com/rack/rack/issues/1075 is still a problem though.\n\nI am getting dropped as a recipient to replies on rack-core FYI.

Users\nof earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible as we\ncannot guarantee the continued availability of security fixes for unsupported\nreleases.\n\nCredits\n-------\n```\n\nI've also attached the patch.\n\n@bjeanes what should I put in Credits?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-11-01T21:59:56.708Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T21:59:56.708Z","actor":{"username":"tenderlove","cleared":false,"url":"/tenderlove","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/318/60d828744b5d16813ecbf975fdc453dc4a933f4f_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"attachments":[{"id":369649,"filename":"2-0-multipart-dos.patch","type":"text/x-diff","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/369/649/7954f96e2fd249002351ba7942561e50df4a66d0/2-0-multipart-dos.patch?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%222-0-multipart-dos.patch%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%272-0-multipart-dos.patch\u0026response-content-type=text%2Fx-diff\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ2T6DG5UU%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T145945Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQCyGt%2F6wKTb7WdhbTEehok3geSSNypgF1jy9glhzjfqmQIhAN%2FZ96OUsxT3l%2FcNh%2BJaiqKBQp%2B0XefuAf%2BhfC%2FmhMZBKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgxZblqGtDqM2dUzvNgq1wMBRL4HwjcRdARKHRTYG1WTOwsUnNm5pyWIDl6UX7cxu3S9pxhLAGamITa%2Bry536DE0dNafGhdIyPeponbLp8FxjTVDEDmVrSlc3vq07ilX%2FsvaFMPbfLwUFwN8DcJVAZSLYZA6zDdeKNCgrZ1ISy%2BuSl%2F8sa9Nj%2FKFffdAxrEzWdcbmnUnTxt6PFvOqigHySvKHcRU1WUlzR%2BJNQhShWoYk3WMwt3lGEOyDeyEBa1PjWzXfwU5hwfOCygWSHeqe3rws%2Fy%2FAjcJ4Igs3dp7VWi2gpey9dMnBlv29eq43WYKyQ6K0q%2FC9l73EFZqlsoZAnNWCF%2BaMWp%2FSNCQCoi6LiyTT3H7xbPsVAE%2F%2B6%2B%2Fmd5o4HWlwOrPWTPapPHw%2BSF0OGtEIdy9BSNcjjpsTprmH3CxZWrOiVUBzDRDrImWT3QqtKWRETxE5UkMEesELPvS1Vr78fUKmIPG33W64ks49siCJg%2BYlvii52MslCAhwi8OBai4EvmsepnSL4Y7WjbGc31Zh7uWP1tOMXaSXgoK4ZXpbX9aNZgfinEq%2FEdjmz1acLqkVL8LTALuORrCaSQNzbL1VsrMHnDQY5Ip6UHG9W3WhTLOB2rMmAx%2FYtqF%2F2HrLRQRuA5lXPow%2F4aRiwY6pAFiuHIrJ99Gk48YedhIWLylCmpLudXTrjRTQ5%2BPJgz8sHy%2FJL%2BbYgchWh7RyeRvXCGWkecfBiAUWkHftxJlLxZP3R4oliu1hG1pnP80N0SBXLpKCFAQqqhncEnNPuXaqUaPMjKqpRRMw76WlTCCpu34SiacreJDZDO6dLymqMm3OX1OpD5Y13L2IbUTLcllZFway4EkA3FPk2PKaxAARwJYsWedpQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=556c1e2982d00f9ae2dec80731dcddb168b81e62913ccdea4f7d90ff74a3ad51"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3572583,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-11-01T22:01:30.551Z","updated_at":"2018-11-01T22:01:30.551Z","actor":{"username":"tenderlove","cleared":false,"url":"/tenderlove","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/318/60d828744b5d16813ecbf975fdc453dc4a933f4f_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3573015,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@tenderlove \n\n\u003e We don't typically yank gems in the case of a security release.
