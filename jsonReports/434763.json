Thanks for submitting a report! Please replace *all* the [square] sections below with the pertinent details. Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to triage and respond quickly, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!\n\n**Summary:** \nThe OAuth screen can be tricked into saying that an app cannot read Direct Messages. Despite that, DMs can be read.\n\n**Description:** \nThe official Twitter API keys have been leaked and are in use in several popular apps.\nThe iPhone keys and Google TV keys (as seen on https://gist.github.com/shobotch/5160017) present an OAuth screen which says the app \"Will not be able to:   Access your direct messages.\"\nThis is false.  The apps *can* read DMs.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)\n\n  1. Ask the user to do the OAuth dance with a token generated from the official keys.\n  1. User sees that the app cannot read DMs.\n  1. User authorises.\n  1. App now has unauthorised access to DMs.\n  1. User is sad that their privacy has been violated.\n\n## Impact: [add why this issue matters]\nA user may not want a 3rd party app to have access to their DMs.\n\nThey rely on the OAuth screen to adequately inform them of the permissions they are granting.\n\nIs this a GDPR violation? I'm not sure. You are telling users that the 3rd party app can't read their private information - but that is false. These API keys do allow access from *any* app which integrates them.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * Screenshot of the OAuth screen for Google TV\n  * Screenshot of the OAuth screen for iPhone\n\n## Impact\n\nUnauthorised access to Direct Messages.","bounty_amount":"2940.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,940","weakness":{"id":46,"name":"Privacy

The Twitter for iOS and Twitter for Android applications do not show a user consent dialog because OAuth is an underlying technical detail rather than an approval process to grant permission from an authenticated session. In these flows, the user uses their credentials (username \u0026 password) to exchange for a token, which simplifies how these applications are able to consume data. We revoked the Twitter for Google TV application since it is no longer needed and reviewed third party applications to determine if any had the potential to access data that they were not authorized to. We'll approve the disclosure in HackerOne shortly.\n\nThanks for helping keep Twitter secure!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-12-13T22:10:09.968Z","updated_at":"2018-12-13T22:10:09.968Z","actor":{"username":"andrewsorensen","cleared":false,"url":"/andrewsorensen","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3823064,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-12-14T00:01:16.015Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T00:01:16.015Z","actor":{"username":"andrewsorensen","cleared":false,"url":"/andrewsorensen","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3823065,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-12-14T00:01:16.091Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T00:01:16.091Z","actor":{"username":"andrewsorensen","cleared":false,"url":"/andrewsorensen","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"id":12781,"category":"team","content":"The reporter discovered that when a select set of applications are authenticated using a PIN or non-intended OAuth flow, the permission dialog that is shown may not show the permissions that the application has.
