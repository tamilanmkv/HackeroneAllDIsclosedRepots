If you see the user type in `123456`, that only helps you narrow down the secret a bit, since a very large number of secrets will hash to that code at a given timestep. You have to make several observations to be able to reduce the number of possible secrets enough to predict the code at some given timestep and bypass the TOTP challenge.\n\n---\n\nIf I'm doing the observation math right:\n\nEach code is 6 numeric digits long (one million values, `000000` through `999999`), so slightly less than 20 bits of entropy. I think we actually need only 4 observations to find an 80-bit secret if we can do the hashing for free: each observation essentially reduces the solution space by 2^20. And we need only 8 observations for a 160-bit secret. These numbers are very small and it's reasonable to make this many observations casually.\n\nWe accept codes with a small amount of clock skew which makes it a little trickier, but maybe this adds one extra observation at the end.\n\nThe number of required observations being so small perhaps motivates making the secret as long as possible, since it's less practical to make 50 observations (for a 1024 bit secret) than 4 observations. If you have a keylogger it doesn't matter a ton, but if you're looking through a spyglass or shoulder surfing this is a lot of observations to make. Today, many users might take a year or more to respond to 50 prompts.\n\nOne thought: perhaps we should consider limited-use TOTP tokens. For example, the shared secret is 1024-bit but you can only enter tokens 32 times before you must cycle it. This means an attacker can never make enough observations to find the secret, even if they can do all the hashing instantly. However, this would be a huge painful burden for users who already routinely lose their phones, get confused about which tokens are associated with which servers, etc. I probably wouldn't want to make this the default mode, but maybe something to think about in the future (and post-\u003chttps://secure.phabricator.com/T9515\u003e for \"Quorum\" TOTP recovery).\n\n---\n\nOn the actual hashing, I think hashing the first timestep is the hard part. Confirming hashes which match the 2nd..Nth observations gets easier by 2^20 each time, so the additional cost isn't significant overall. You may also have to do the initial round of hashing multiple times to handle clock skew, but that only makes it worse by some constant factor.\n\nYour numbers seem reasonable to me, but if we make more liberal assumptions and take the Bitcoin pool hash rate of ~2^45 hashes/s and fudge that a bit for SHA1 vs SHA256 and maybe end up around 2^55, it's only about a year to compute all the inputs for an 80-bit secret. That still not terribly plausible, but is more in the realm of \"motivated state actors might be able to do this in the lifetime of the software\" than \"heat death of the universe\".\n\nIf SHA gets dramatically cheaper with quantum computing I suspect a lot of bets are probably off, so I'm less worried about that.\n\n---\n\nIt also costs us essentially nothing to use arbitrarily long secrets, and we always get a linear benefit in terms of number of required observations from increasing the size of the secret. The limiting factor is probably just that common TOTP phone applications will stop working at some point. But if the major ones support, say, 32,000 bit secrets that means an attacker needs to make 1,600 observations to reliably predict the next code, which is years of time spent keylogging/spyglassing.\n\nI'll see what I can dig up on the *maximum* practical length we can use here.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-11-07T15:49:36.290Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T15:49:36.290Z","actor":{"username":"epriestley","cleared":false,"url":"/epriestley","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/043/3ebca5250ea5abd54b49ccc9d69c636af4585b2e_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"phabricator","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3601767,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Here's a Yubico issue for 80-character secrets failing in 2015, but this has apparently been fixed:\n\n\u003chttps://github.com/Yubico/yubioath-desktop/issues/24\u003e\n\nI wasn't able to dig up too much other evidence about overly-long keys.\n\n\u003e It also costs us essentially nothing to use arbitrarily long secrets...\n\nThis isn't true if users actually type them in manually.

If you can make 8 observations (for a 160-bit code) you can probably make as many observations as you want and the next real limit is just how many times users actually enter codes. If we could require attackers to make more observations than the number of codes users will ever realistically enter (eg., 1000+) I think there would be value in that, but a couple dozen observations either way feels a bit like splitting hairs.\n\nOverall, since using truly huge values and treating TOTP like a one-time pad doesn't seem practical, I'm inclined to just double this to 160 bits and call it a day for now.\n\nI anticipate expanding MFA support at least somewhat in the future (e.g., to add Yubikey) and we could reasonably add a \"Huge Bit Length TOTP\" factor or something which uses 16,000-bit keys, expires periodically or after you enter a hundred keys, etc., if we wanted to really harden this.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-11-07T16:17:19.390Z","updated_at":"2018-11-07T16:17:19.390Z","actor":{"username":"epriestley","cleared":false,"url":"/epriestley","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/043/3ebca5250ea5abd54b49ccc9d69c636af4585b2e_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"attachments":[{"id":372106,"filename":"Screen_Shot_2018-11-07_at_8.00.59_AM.png","type":"image/png","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/372/106/089ea96704de896f239f84d828e02979d5d71afd/Screen_Shot_2018-11-07_at_8.00.59_AM.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Screen_Shot_2018-11-07_at_8.00.59_AM.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Screen_Shot_2018-11-07_at_8.00.59_AM.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQTQR22CE2%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T150002Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHylhpFJOF4pRe7XlaDX6z3BLEup%2BswnNkaACr%2Fwjwr8AiASjuyeD0TYwrZA5sOldf5eC6UQrO8hSHC9jNR%2BVNumhyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMfK%2BofD1wJOHYcOUJKtcDnC3f8Y3jglGs7z8YlxF9bdYkYlsSrPxEkx9hDqtH%2BQ3u1daZrwyM6F3WHlk0a%2BWNezGk%2FnRxFWuvgXlXXAEBaCUWEe1UXv97gs6KKr%2F4fZ92%2FH3VXeVMioYLi220Z8qDdmiwSK2Z%2FPfK0nlRhO3v9Ee3r3C7BMq5B4DRnfxp0cJyzU%2FHbMNzQNjyO%2BlGzreHCzcyKBe%2FoFAr2W6xbLokCINrIUxMnvI9Mxs7SraD%2FF2sZw8Ln4uZ6aJweQoOPwsnYKkrRjb370Lt%2FREkrEj9pcgae0C9R5BTZegZaqNN6CzMkZfNHB7RmNrhJFg6j7%2BfPYLcWFNxzvJV9dbVJdocqrM5Jmi3hE47KOBrMSGuFrCha2vRk9P64hqfhM1GdDtMLFZZn5VqOJgdyVWZ8bTrZpmlBP%2FJ6YiHIaMTH8G%2FRndaRrVRAR8iOSqWok%2FikWajxMvcVA29H%2F5RznwCFPkLrSbv34tOiWcwVp50Yy3HjkGq4LnY67LMRRRIwThQ9vc%2BM3G9xlb7TwO6%2F3vE5U6azDCH6hDFQ3Xi8ZJVYrTOOWINnf%2BC3BIhvL8Uql%2FhI1vUmbQiAR01xN%2FdEQ9ReTSo0pfJ3SDSXhBXiwUW0IRKspJO189rJyI3MImNkYsGOqYBwdOGh60JXyl1FPj8jwEbnfg6var6H0hyaUwn%2B%2FnamMWODqDwoSJI6f0Q6RJHnQJo2gfc6OFgj1W2B%2FGcJDL4gMvwPBD8bBDDMSaZ3x1nqw%2FhzMwsaQP%2BTnUJEKAVQSe3o5Yvwzg%2FSvpNP%2By981FbIZs9aWoGNPHY48ZIUNdNLCWPS2PxNm9xHrAxEcqn8ib1XLvQQS%2FALl2CG36%2BewUP2tPIf%2BIPmw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=9434d881308cdd006bee49711106b509e9dd3fbbb57a55d38675995c4185d33b"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"phabricator","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3602028,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"This should be fixed by \u003chttps://secure.phabricator.com/D19792\u003e, which increases the secret to 160 bits.
