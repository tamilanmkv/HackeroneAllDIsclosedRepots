The forgot password parameter can be brute forced through which an attacker can get the email address.\n\n##Steps to Reproduce\n\n\u003e Enter your email address and for the forgot password parameter.\n\u003e Capture the request in the proxy.\n\u003e Brute for the parameter using different email address.\n\u003e Check the different request and see the response.\n\nThe right email and the wrong email will have different response and request length. Hence, the attack is successful.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact is obvious here. As you can see, the vulnerability is about the email address leakage of the smule accounts. The email address leakage of the account is said to be prohibited. The confidential data of the Smule application can be leaked.\n\n###Mitigation\n\nAdd rate limit on the application.\nUse CAPTCHA verification if many request is sent.","weakness":{"id":31,"name":"Brute Force"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-05-13T15:32:41.264Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-76202882.10311991,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":27,"voters":["bugbountier","kushaldhkl","ali","dhakal_bibek","eveeez","its_afolic","justm0rph3u5","cryptographer","adddd","mr_toad","and 17 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":8863,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.smule.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3677676,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your submission.
