It is possible to perform the following actions against a target without their knowledge or interaction. With no account takeover scenario.\n\nIt's a case of, if I know the mobile number... I can control basic functions of the account.\n\nI can do everything that is listed here: https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/sms-commands on an account, completely unauthenticated.\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)\n\n  1. Spoof target number, send an SMS to a special short code for the geographical location, as seen here: https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/supported-mobile-carriers\n\n\n## Impact: Massive. I can remove the SMS two factor of the account. I can DM people without them knowing. If I had the mobile number of Donald Trump, I could send Tweets as him... There is so much wrong here. \n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * List any additional material (e.g. screenshots, logs, etc.)\n\nhttps://twitter.com/___Sh4rk___/status/1076204152546619392 this is a tweet I sent from my close friends account. She did not reveal her password or authenticate it at all.\n\n## Impact\n\nRemove 2FA\n\nTweet on someones behalf.\n\nDM Someone.\n\nDelete someones tweets\n\nTurn off all phone SMS notifications\n\nFollow people\n\nUnfollow people.\n\nBlock/Report people - with a little script I could get 10000 phone numbers all reporting innocent tweets.

If you believe you can still spoof any account that is NOT capable of setting a PIN via the web interface as described at https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/sms-pin, please let us know.\n\nWe're still evaluating potential long term mitigations related to SMS spoofing in general, but we plan to close this report soon as we believe we are back to the point where the mitigations published in the 2012 blog post are working again. The vast majority of Twitter users are on shortcode networks and should not be spoofable. The small minority of users on longcode networks should have the option of setting a PIN to prevent spoofing. If you believe this is not correct, please let us know.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-01-03T19:00:22.642Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T19:00:22.642Z","actor":{"username":"asayler","cleared":false,"url":"/asayler","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/157/395/70da753edd29b342a463a7ef9c2e75cb22ce35d8_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3921493,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"In addition I feel an SMS should be sent to vulnerable users and default changes to account configurations should be made which enable a PIN. \n\nAs for further testing I am unlikely to verify this or do further work because you’ve already opted out of paying for my time as it is.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-01-03T19:20:10.754Z","updated_at":"2019-01-03T19:20:10.754Z","actor":{"username":"antisocial_eng","cleared":false,"url":"/antisocial_eng","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/153/012/95d0cd0c733cdee7357b75d289a836ef056802df_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3921736,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"We consider this issue to be fixed now.
