Note that the details of the report aren't shared (even though the issues have long since been published upstream).\n\nIdeally, Hackerone will investigate why the IBB team are so unresponsive, why the mediation team give unrealistic timeframes, and why the mediation team are also so unresponsive.\n\nThis whole process, spanning an entire year, makes me not want to continue using the Hackerone platform, as it is clear that the staff there do not care for the researchers at all.\n\nReally all I have requested is a realistic expectation of a timeframe on when these issues will be resolved. In previous years this process has taken around 6 months, and I never felt like I was out of communication with the team. This time however I feel extremely disconnected with no responses from either IBB or hackerone themselves.\n\nWhat has changed?\n\nCheers,\n\nHugh","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-01-06T00:59:19.024Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T00:59:19.024Z","actor":{"username":"haquaman","cleared":false,"url":"/haquaman","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/646/07cbfc394d4d3432eb95cf9735f225ea803090bb_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9478393,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-09T23:59:04.543Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T23:59:04.543Z","actor":{"url":"/ibb","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/variants/v0qywgoh5hm4cbhuanu8mqdtowhr/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22ibb%20revision%205%20copy.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ibb%2520revision%25205%2520copy.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQXEQ3VCGF%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T150400Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQCNbr25hK1JC2i73IX5uE08m1agZwA%2BCyxTPtXmxpZHFAIgA9v21iU9rOtKWjxfMHo7kqQOL4Y8ABbAnucRVLpaC9cqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDOyim%2FBwzSkIWBPCWirXA1TUfPlTIAz6iDfoaiiMP8hivTDD8uDyRJ%2FoAF5UW%2F6cSrWHj2Mtt%2Fx8tKTYSGoQiyhUdi%2BFdxLY35ZRGqE5k10GcpBa5q9ivBUHzTLtIbzvkVLjo0GDs33RjPyv8lT8%2BIT3cR1GpHz5sKugzk1wJHpaXHIGV7TsNZTez5PsxRWLAbodD46%2Bv0aY9dXICvo8Bld1OIiDoUsI3sX2R7SAEjL0B45opfmY7Hh4KKVF9KyCf7etmcGEL0U%2Bjij5TfmuHRxoVJXFKR4WbBKoHXN3cL5AQhAkGBE5bmE6cTsvfhMkCltMfmR1OmQtt1QK7fs2YWSyJhNNnjgzseVzroJk8qcktNvGQQNtmAz%2F0hi%2BbLDdR3r35MBTZtRPxGxwfYKfk%2Blyikhar%2F%2FfPxr6sJoQhbcKSjiziR8cFwFPC97f3qfgH6sVJVvH5AClhLDj9FMqequ01uI1FMQI%2BQ1BJ1t%2Bl3dX7D09OZCMRrk3HvidiN7al4fmx5e0pKMz7tbb23gSzvgiMJbXeHgATiARA8dz6JIoLosFubesB7ZLWq9owsMVaP42CuihB%2Br9J9vu1HkgY4lcWvgRt8bqCjXjWDPBzlNcnc9D32bMJUDfp2BWdJ0BCnpEi4XjrDCyiJGLBjqlAbw%2BQzzkBo5pgpwg2B9K3Kb9khz80zQhxWTR4UFlyZpApeXe135MxtRrVWf1VeEC8qBZynSiicNEE5qSEPmd%2FKNSihzfYJ9PmbUkfZN9yFsrIArapjiCpWMywbnOVNeLSHMFFv8xtfh0sOTI4VetTtHS5BxyHny%2BvnXM6Hjudg5tfOAvbwkv9j%2BTfq0Y0YGFWvyUNrCeX3Y3zQ5t8ked%2FqOvxUSYeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=f2abc9c1c1f0cf28bcf86374e6dc0338a0417706cf855fc65e52779d39f11378"},"profile":{"name":"Internet Bug Bounty"}},"bounty_amount":"1500.0","bounty_currency":"usd","bonus_amount":"0.0","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","collaborator":{"username":"haquaman","url":"/haquaman"},"actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9478395,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Hello @haquaman,\n\nOn behalf of the Internet Bug Bounty Panel, thank you for your continued patience on this report. The IBB requires that all in-scope open source projects be mutually engaged with us to ensure there is a good experience for all.
