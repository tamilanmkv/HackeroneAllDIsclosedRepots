The response I got from the mediation team was that I would get a response within 7 days (request #270031, from Chris at Sep 11, 17:51 PDT), and if not I should let the team know.\n\nI did not receive a response, and emailed back on Sept 24. I did not receive a response from that either. I emailed again, and made another comment on #476168 regarding the lack of response from the IBB team, and the mediation team.\n\nI note that now been an entire year since these issues were reported, and the issues were resolved upstream shortly after. It has been 8 months since all the reports were triaged, which was also the last I have heard from the IBB team despite asking for updates every few months.\n\nI also requested mediation a month ago on #476179, but am yet to hear anything back from the mediation team, or anything from them about the lack of response after 7 days back in September.\n\nI'm OK with a program that takes a long time to reach resolution, but I'm not OK with the complete lack of transparency and openness. I've requested multiple times an update from the IBB team, but have not had a response from them for 6 months. It would be great if the IBB team or hackerone can set some expectations and outline these to researchers.\n\nAlso, I would be interested in why the mediation team gave an expectation of an update of 7 days, then never responded when that timeframe expired. What is the point of mediation if the mediators can't actually mediate or communicate with researchers?\n\nCan I please get an update on why this has taken so long, and when I can expect these 3 reports to get resolved?\n\nCheers,\n\nHugh","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-01-06T00:54:15.890Z","updated_at":"2020-01-06T00:54:15.890Z","actor":{"username":"haquaman","cleared":false,"url":"/haquaman","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/017/646/07cbfc394d4d3432eb95cf9735f225ea803090bb_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9478389,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-09T23:58:33.044Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T23:58:33.044Z","actor":{"url":"/ibb","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/variants/v0qywgoh5hm4cbhuanu8mqdtowhr/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22ibb%20revision%205%20copy.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ibb%2520revision%25205%2520copy.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ2T6DG5UU%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T150401Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQCyGt%2F6wKTb7WdhbTEehok3geSSNypgF1jy9glhzjfqmQIhAN%2FZ96OUsxT3l%2FcNh%2BJaiqKBQp%2B0XefuAf%2BhfC%2FmhMZBKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgxZblqGtDqM2dUzvNgq1wMBRL4HwjcRdARKHRTYG1WTOwsUnNm5pyWIDl6UX7cxu3S9pxhLAGamITa%2Bry536DE0dNafGhdIyPeponbLp8FxjTVDEDmVrSlc3vq07ilX%2FsvaFMPbfLwUFwN8DcJVAZSLYZA6zDdeKNCgrZ1ISy%2BuSl%2F8sa9Nj%2FKFffdAxrEzWdcbmnUnTxt6PFvOqigHySvKHcRU1WUlzR%2BJNQhShWoYk3WMwt3lGEOyDeyEBa1PjWzXfwU5hwfOCygWSHeqe3rws%2Fy%2FAjcJ4Igs3dp7VWi2gpey9dMnBlv29eq43WYKyQ6K0q%2FC9l73EFZqlsoZAnNWCF%2BaMWp%2FSNCQCoi6LiyTT3H7xbPsVAE%2F%2B6%2B%2Fmd5o4HWlwOrPWTPapPHw%2BSF0OGtEIdy9BSNcjjpsTprmH3CxZWrOiVUBzDRDrImWT3QqtKWRETxE5UkMEesELPvS1Vr78fUKmIPG33W64ks49siCJg%2BYlvii52MslCAhwi8OBai4EvmsepnSL4Y7WjbGc31Zh7uWP1tOMXaSXgoK4ZXpbX9aNZgfinEq%2FEdjmz1acLqkVL8LTALuORrCaSQNzbL1VsrMHnDQY5Ip6UHG9W3WhTLOB2rMmAx%2FYtqF%2F2HrLRQRuA5lXPow%2F4aRiwY6pAFiuHIrJ99Gk48YedhIWLylCmpLudXTrjRTQ5%2BPJgz8sHy%2FJL%2BbYgchWh7RyeRvXCGWkecfBiAUWkHftxJlLxZP3R4oliu1hG1pnP80N0SBXLpKCFAQqqhncEnNPuXaqUaPMjKqpRRMw76WlTCCpu34SiacreJDZDO6dLymqMm3OX1OpD5Y13L2IbUTLcllZFway4EkA3FPk2PKaxAARwJYsWedpQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=5df7253ec5c4126876c8f94ca3a2b09c191c6e2560a51c382ee0c3a9e3d01e30"},"profile":{"name":"Internet Bug Bounty"}},"bounty_amount":"1500.0","bounty_currency":"usd","bonus_amount":"0.0","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","collaborator":{"username":"haquaman","url":"/haquaman"},"actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9478390,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Hello @haquaman,\n\nOn behalf of the Internet Bug Bounty Panel, thank you for your continued patience on this report. The IBB requires that all in-scope open source projects be mutually engaged with us to ensure there is a good experience for all.

Bounty amounts are decided on based on the PHP policy and severity assigned on the accompanying CVE. \n\nAs an act of good faith, we will also close this report as Resolved.\n\nThank you for helping keep the internet safe and secure!\n-The Internet Bug Bounty Panel \n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-09T23:58:48.435Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T23:58:48.435Z","actor":{"username":"reed","cleared":false,"url":"/reed","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/132/66d7eadcea16b878bb67bfd697b9542250a801a7_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"haquaman","url":"/haquaman"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9478701,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-10T01:48:50.963Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T01:48:50.963Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"reed","cleared":false,"url":"/reed","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/132/66d7eadcea16b878bb67bfd697b9542250a801a7_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9762806,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-11-09T01:48:54.520Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T01:48:54.520Z","actor":{"url":"/ibb","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/variants/v0qywgoh5hm4cbhuanu8mqdtowhr/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22ibb%20revision%205%20copy.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ibb%2520revision%25205%2520copy.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ2T6DG5UU%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T150401Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQCyGt%2F6wKTb7WdhbTEehok3geSSNypgF1jy9glhzjfqmQIhAN%2FZ96OUsxT3l%2FcNh%2BJaiqKBQp%2B0XefuAf%2BhfC%2FmhMZBKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgxZblqGtDqM2dUzvNgq1wMBRL4HwjcRdARKHRTYG1WTOwsUnNm5pyWIDl6UX7cxu3S9pxhLAGamITa%2Bry536DE0dNafGhdIyPeponbLp8FxjTVDEDmVrSlc3vq07ilX%2FsvaFMPbfLwUFwN8DcJVAZSLYZA6zDdeKNCgrZ1ISy%2BuSl%2F8sa9Nj%2FKFffdAxrEzWdcbmnUnTxt6PFvOqigHySvKHcRU1WUlzR%2BJNQhShWoYk3WMwt3lGEOyDeyEBa1PjWzXfwU5hwfOCygWSHeqe3rws%2Fy%2FAjcJ4Igs3dp7VWi2gpey9dMnBlv29eq43WYKyQ6K0q%2FC9l73EFZqlsoZAnNWCF%2BaMWp%2FSNCQCoi6LiyTT3H7xbPsVAE%2F%2B6%2B%2Fmd5o4HWlwOrPWTPapPHw%2BSF0OGtEIdy9BSNcjjpsTprmH3CxZWrOiVUBzDRDrImWT3QqtKWRETxE5UkMEesELPvS1Vr78fUKmIPG33W64ks49siCJg%2BYlvii52MslCAhwi8OBai4EvmsepnSL4Y7WjbGc31Zh7uWP1tOMXaSXgoK4ZXpbX9aNZgfinEq%2FEdjmz1acLqkVL8LTALuORrCaSQNzbL1VsrMHnDQY5Ip6UHG9W3WhTLOB2rMmAx%2FYtqF%2F2HrLRQRuA5lXPow%2F4aRiwY6pAFiuHIrJ99Gk48YedhIWLylCmpLudXTrjRTQ5%2BPJgz8sHy%2FJL%2BbYgchWh7RyeRvXCGWkecfBiAUWkHftxJlLxZP3R4oliu1hG1pnP80N0SBXLpKCFAQqqhncEnNPuXaqUaPMjKqpRRMw76WlTCCpu34SiacreJDZDO6dLymqMm3OX1OpD5Y13L2IbUTLcllZFway4EkA3FPk2PKaxAARwJYsWedpQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=5df7253ec5c4126876c8f94ca3a2b09c191c6e2560a51c382ee0c3a9e3d01e30"},"profile":{"name":"Internet Bug Bounty"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
