link to the PHP bug: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77270\n\nThis is possible to exploit in PHP 7.0.33 and 5.6.39. I used this vulnerability to write a local safe mode bypass exploit.\n\nIt is possible to write up to 1200 bytes over the boundaries of a buffer allocated in the imagecolormatch function, which then calls gdImageColorMatch()\n\nThe function takes two gdImagePtr as arguments and wants to compare both of them. It then allocates a dynamic buffer with the following calculation:\n\n`buf = (unsigned long *)safe_emalloc(sizeof(unsigned long), 5 * im2-\u003ecolorsTotal, 0);`\n\nim2-\u003ecolorsTotal is under the control of an attacker. By simply allocating only one color to the second image, the calculation becomes sizeof(unsigned long) (8 byte on a 64 bit system) * 5 * 1, which results in a buffer of 40 bytes.\n\n```\nThe buffer is then written to in a for loop.\n\tfor (x=0; x\u003cim1-\u003esx; x++) {\n\t\tfor( y=0; y\u003cim1-\u003esy; y++ ) {\n\t\t\tcolor = im2-\u003epixels[y][x];\n\t\t\trgb = im1-\u003etpixels[y][x];\n\t\t\tbp = buf + (color * 5);\n\t\t\t(*(bp++))++;\n\t\t\t*(bp++) += gdTrueColorGetRed(rgb);\n\t\t\t*(bp++) += gdTrueColorGetGreen(rgb);\n\t\t\t*(bp++) += gdTrueColorGetBlue(rgb);\n\t\t\t*(bp++) += gdTrueColorGetAlpha(rgb);\n\t\t}\n\nThe buffer is written to by means of a color being the index:\ncolor = im2-\u003epixels[y][x];\n..\nbp = buf + (color * 5);\n```\n\nHowever, an attacker can set the value of color to be at maximum 255 (since it is a char). This would result in bp pointing at buffer + 1275 bytes. Since buffer is only 40 bytes big, this leads to an out of bounds write with data that is also under the control of the attacker.\n\nPoC PHP script:\n\n```\n$img1 = imagecreatetruecolor(0xfff, 0xfff);\n$img2 = imagecreate(0xfff, 0xfff);\nimagecolorallocate($img2, 0, 0, 0);\nimagesetpixel($img2, 0, 0, 255);\nimagecolormatch($img1, $img2);\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability allows attackers to bypass local security restrictions such as disabled functions.","bounty_amount":"1500.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,500","weakness":{"id":2,"name":"Memory Corruption - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-11-09T01:48:21.794Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-29078152.445294537,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["mik317","pagolmoon3","yazaw","54v174r"],"severity":{"rating":"high","score":8.8,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":84120,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"PHP","max_severity":"none"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4002594,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @simonscannell - Thanks for the submission.

The IBB requires that all in-scope open source projects be mutually engaged with us to ensure there is a good experience for all. Unfortunately, we have not been able to maintain that relationship with the upstream PHP community, and as a result, HackerOne and the IBB Panel have collectively agreed to shut down the program indefinitely.\n\nIn an effort to reward researchers for their hard work and patience thus far, the IBB panel has elected to pay bounties to all valid reports without PHP’s input.
