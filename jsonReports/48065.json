Could you give me more information on a possible attack scenario?  Once I click 'Authorize' it does indeed redirect me to a 'bad' address, but I'm not sure that I see the security impact.  Any attacker that did this on purpose would have to convince a user to give their app authorization in the first place.  And if a developer mistyped an address for the callback, they would likely catch it very quickly as the callback wouldn't be receiving any data.
