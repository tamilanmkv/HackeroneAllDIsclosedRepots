just noticed I left out part of my report.\n\n**Description:**\nReferencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash.\n\nThe use of heap allocated memory after it has been freed or deleted leads to undefined system behavior and, in many cases, to a write-what-where condition.\n\nUse after free errors occur when a program continues to use a pointer after it has been freed. Like double free errors and memory leaks, use after free errors have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:\n\n* Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances\n* Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory \n\nUse after free errors sometimes have no effect and other times cause a program to crash. While it is technically feasible for the freed memory to be re-allocated and for an attacker to use this reallocation to launch a buffer overflow attack, we are unaware of any exploits based on this type of attack.\n\nThe use of previously freed memory can have any number of adverse consequences - ranging from the corruption of valid data to the execution of arbitrary code, depending on the instantiation and timing of the flaw.\n\nThe simplest way data corruption may occur involves the system's reuse of the freed memory. In this scenario, the memory in question is allocated to another pointer validly at some point after it has been freed. The original pointer to the freed memory is used again and points to somewhere within the new allocation. As the data is changed, it corrupts the validly used memory; this induces undefined behavior in the process.\n\nIf the newly allocated data chances to hold a class, in C++ for example, various function pointers may be scattered within the heap data. If one of these function pointers is overwritten with an address to valid shellcode, execution of arbitrary code can be achieved.

I'm having some doubts on whether this issue is valid. I think this is a false positive reported by AddressSanitizer, I'll explain below why. When I try to reproduce your report I'm just getting a \"INVALID ALGORITHM\" error after which the application exits. I don't see any crash happening, which is likely to be expected in this case.\n\nAlso looking purely as the source code I'm having some doubts:\n\ncmdgen.c, lines 813-821:\n```c\n                    if (alg)\n                        bits = ssh_key_public_bits(\n                            alg, ptrlen_from_strbuf(ssh2blob));\n                    else\n                        bits = -1;\n                } else {\n \u003e\u003e                 strbuf_free(ssh2blob);      // AddressSanitizer triggers on this \"free\" \n                }\n                sfree(ssh2alg);\n```\n\ncmdgen.c, lines 972-983:\n```c\n\n                if (!ssh2blob) {\n                    assert(ssh2key);\n                    ssh2blob = strbuf_new();\n                    ssh_key_public_blob(ssh2key-\u003ekey, BinarySink_UPCAST(ssh2blob));\n                }\n\n                ssh2_write_pubkey(fp, ssh2key ? ssh2key-\u003ecomment : origcomment,\n  \u003e\u003e                              ssh2blob-\u003es, ssh2blob-\u003elen,   // AddressSanitizer \"use after free\"\n                                  (outtype == PUBLIC ?\n                                   SSH_KEYTYPE_SSH2_PUBLIC_RFC4716 :\n                                   SSH_KEYTYPE_SSH2_PUBLIC_OPENSSH));\n            }\n```\n\nSo AddressSanitizer reports a \"use-after-free\" on line 979. However if you look up a few lines you'll see that the buffer is allocated again if it was clear before: ```sh2blob = strbuf_new();```.\n\n@lasagna ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-01-18T08:19:00.616Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T08:19:00.616Z","actor":{"username":"lasagna","cleared":false,"url":"/lasagna","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/400/990/cfa7194b276688d13e7062cf5b49e5adb1ae2501_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"putty_h1c","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4000021,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Valgrind reports the same behvavior on a non-ASan build (64-bit), so I find it hard to believe this is a false positive @lasagna:\n\n```\nvalgrind -q ./puttygen -L test0025.ppk                                                             \n\n==25849== Invalid read of size 4\n==25849==    at 0x10D584: main (cmdgen.c:978)\n==25849==  Address 0x53dd658 is 24 bytes inside a block of size 48 free'd\n==25849==    at 0x4C2CDDB: free (vg_replace_malloc.c:530)\n==25849==    by 0x10D9C3: main (cmdgen.c:819)\n==25849==  Block was alloc'd at\n==25849==    at 0x4C2BBAF: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:299)\n==25849==    by 0x116727: safemalloc (memory.c:23)\n==25849==    by 0x1369DF: strbuf_new (utils.c:431)\n==25849==    by 0x10D6E2: main (cmdgen.c:809)\n==25849==\n==25849== Invalid read of size 8\n==25849==    at 0x10D589: main (cmdgen.c:979)\n==25849==  Address 0x53dd648 is 8 bytes inside a block of size 48 free'd\n==25849==    at 0x4C2CDDB: free (vg_replace_malloc.c:530)\n==25849==    by 0x10D9C3: main (cmdgen.c:819)\n==25849==  Block was alloc'd at\n==25849==    at 0x4C2BBAF: malloc (vg_replace_malloc.c:299)\n==25849==    by 0x116727: safemalloc (memory.c:23)\n==25849==    by 0x1369DF: strbuf_new (utils.c:431)\n==25849==    by 0x10D6E2: main (cmdgen.c:809)\n==25849==\nINVALID-ALGORITHM\n```\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-01-18T13:46:01.404Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T13:47:16.257Z","actor":{"username":"geeknik","cleared":false,"url":"/geeknik","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/7xfGZCKCxUuGLYGfuUZM3XyY/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"putty_h1c","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4000048,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Can you provide a PoC that actually crashes puttygen?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-01-18T13:50:51.825Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T13:50:51.825Z","actor":{"username":"lasagna","cleared":false,"url":"/lasagna","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/400/990/cfa7194b276688d13e7062cf5b49e5adb1ae2501_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"putty_h1c","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4003501,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Not all memory errors result in a SIGSEGV, so you have everything I have showing the memory flaw with and without address sanitizer.
