The ssl certificate has also expired 4 years ago.\n\n##Impact\n\nThe POODLE attack can be used against any system or application that supports SSL 3.0 with CBC mode ciphers. This affects most current browsers and websites, but also includes any software that either references a vulnerable SSL/TLS library (e.g. OpenSSL) or implements the SSL/TLS protocol suite itself. By exploiting this vulnerability in a likely web-based scenario, an attacker can gain access to sensitive data passed within the encrypted web session, such as passwords, cookies and other authentication tokens that can then be used to gain more complete access to a website (impersonating that user, accessing database content, etc.).\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\nDisable SSL 2 and SSL 3, renew the certificate and disable weak cyphers like RC4 to further mitigate other issues.\n\n**Sources:**\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA14-290A\n\n## Impact\n\nThe POODLE attack can be used against any system or application that supports SSL 3.0 with CBC mode ciphers.
