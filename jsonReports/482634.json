Origin servers will request any image file supplied by the attacker. This allows for internal NIPR sites to be mapped and accessed through a vulnerable host. The attack is limited by file extension.\n\nImpact\nVulnerable site allows interaction with internal NIPR sites. Pulling default image files from internal NIPR sites verifies the site is online and responsive. Discloses origin IP addresses, and could be manipulated further.  This could also be used as a defacement technique making the sight display images of radical ideologies or pornography.  \n\nStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nAccess the DNN image handler on the vulnerable site.\nSupply Burp collaborator payload (working on free burp right now and cannot provide a collab payload) or external attacker controlled image for SSRF trigger.\nPayload Example:\nhttps://█████/DnnImageHandler.ashx?mode=file\u0026url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q19YK-T_wAU/UdpDm76jIgI/AAAAAAAAAWo/yjeRx4Vet80/s400/meme11.jpg\n\nhttps://████████/DnnImageHandler.ashx?mode=file\u0026url=http://www.███/data/uploads/images/DC3_seal.png\n\nProduct, Version, and Configuration\nDNN 8.0.0 to 9.1.1 with ImageHandler exposed.\n\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nUpgrade to DNN 9.2.0 or later. If upgrading isn't possible, consider blocking requests to ImageHandler if it is unused.\n\n## Impact\n\nRecommend High Severity: Vulnerable site allows interaction with internal NIPR-Only sites. Pulling default image files from internal NIPR sites verifies the site is online and responsive. Discloses origin IP addresses, and could be manipulated further to cause harm on internal NIPR sites. This could also be used as a defacement technique making the sight display images of radical ideologies or pornography.","weakness":{"id":68,"name":"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":3,"voters":["mik317","domssilva","yanger"],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4005161,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
