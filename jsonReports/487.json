As you can see [here](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-2-stable/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/http/url.rb#L97), this is something Rails does for us. Right now our root page returns a 302 and includes a caching header (`max-age=600, public`). CloudFlare [caches these 302s](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200168326-Are-301-and-302-redirects-cached-by-CloudFlare-), but since we don't have a page rule for it the CF cache isn't poisoned. We ran...\n\n```\n$ curl -H 'X-Forwarded-Host: hackerone.com/ibb?test' https://hackerone.com\n```\n\n... for a while, but it keeps hitting our application servers and isn't cached. We don't think this was exploitable in our current configuration, but it was still a good find that made us nervous enough to harden this behavior. We pushed a fix to make sure we don't introduce this security vulnerability when we update CF caching rules.\n\nThanks again!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T19:08:53.240Z","updated_at":"2013-12-03T19:11:51.833Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"reporter":{"username":"michael1026","url":"/michael1026"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2920,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T19:09:40.860Z","updated_at":"2013-12-03T19:09:40.860Z","actor":{"url":"/security","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/013/fa942b9b1cbf4faf37482bf68458e1195aab9c02_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"HackerOne"}},"bounty_amount":"100.0","bounty_currency":"usd","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","collaborator":{"username":"michael1026","url":"/michael1026"},"actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2921,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2013-12-03T19:16:56.563Z","updated_at":"2013-12-03T19:16:56.563Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3391,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-01-09T14:36:42.093Z","updated_at":"2014-01-09T14:36:42.093Z","actor":{"url":"/security","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/013/fa942b9b1cbf4faf37482bf68458e1195aab9c02_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"HackerOne"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
