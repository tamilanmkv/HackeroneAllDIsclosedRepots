This was fixed in [Version 5.16-6 Beta](https://zend.to/changelog.php), although ██████ is still running ZendTo 5.11.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis allows path traversal in a file name that is then returned to the user. Depending on the PHP version ████ is running, this may allow escaping the appended suffix and reading arbitrary local files, which would allow complete compromise of the ██████ system.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\nTo reproduce, this requires being an ████████ account. This could be exploited by sending a malicious link to an ████████ of ████████.\n\n1. If you have access to an █████ account on █████████, visit `https://█████/graph.php?p=7\u0026m=../../../../../../usr/share/apache2/icons/pie` as a POC. This loads an image of a pie, demonstrating the path traversal vulnerability.\n2. Without access to an ████ account, visit my server at https://████/ and log in with username `████████` and password `██████`.\n3. Visit https://████/graph.php?m=dropoff_count\u0026p=7\u0026m=../../../../../../usr/share/apache2/icons/pie. Observe the tiny image of a pie, demonstrating path traversal.\n\n## Vulnerable Code\n\nThe following block of code (in `graph.php`) reads a file from the `m` parameter unfiltered:\n\n```\nif ( $period \u0026\u0026 ($metric = $_GET['m']) || ($metric = $_POST['metric']) ) {\n      if ( is_readable($path = RRD_DATA_DIR.$metric.$period.'.png') ) {\n        readfile($path);\n        exit(0);\n      }\n    }\n```\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\n\nZendTo \u003c 5.16-6 Beta\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\nUpdate the ZendTo software.\n\n## Impact\n\n.","weakness":{"id":19,"name":"Path Traversal"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":1,"voters":["cromo"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4113198,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
