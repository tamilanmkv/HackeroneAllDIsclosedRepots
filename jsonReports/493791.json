There is no cache control and the browser saves sensitive information of a private chat room.\nThis report is influenced by the disclosed report #407763. The impact and attack scenario is also the same.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Sign in to Gitter\n2. Go to a private room\n3. Sign-out from the device\n4. Click on backspace\n5. Chat in the private room\n\nYou can access the private room without actually being logged in. You can also chat from the logged out account.\n\n## Impact\n\nSensitive information can get disclosed through a single backspace.","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":470287,"original_report_url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/470287","attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":12,"voters":["kushaldhkl","dhakal_bibek","tim0n","adddd","armansameer","akax","char00kw","mgprasanth","test_dude","ctf_hacker","and 2 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18135,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.gitter.im","max_severity":"none"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4125071,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @dhakalananda,\n\nThank you for submitting this report.
