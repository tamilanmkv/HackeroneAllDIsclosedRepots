Please review the exploit which i have provided as this scenario is all aspects should warrant a reward.\n\nI am again giving you the exploit,\n\nAn Interesting Exploit:\n\nWhen you create a Hackerone Team, by default you will become its Team manager. You cannot leave the team unless you invite someone else and assign that user as the Team Manager. Suppose you(User1) want to leave the team of which you are the only single manager, then by following the above steps as mentioned in Scenario[2], you can force another hackerone user(User2) to become a Team Manager(While sending the invite, Check the \"Manage Team\" check box).\n\nTherefore, going with scenario[2], if User2 receives an invite to join a team and logins into his hackerone account, he automatically becomes the new manager of the Team. At this very moment, User1 can leave the Team as his \"Leave Team\" link becomes enabled. User1 immediately clicks \"Leave Team\" and exsits from the team he created.\n\nUnkowing of what permissions was given to User2 by User1, if User2 now wants to leave the Team which he was forced joined automatically by Hackerone, he wouldn't be able to leave the team as he has become the new \"Team Manager\"(Its mandatory for each team to have minimum of 1 Team manager)\n\nUser2 can only leave the team if he invites someone else(say User3) as the manager and that they(User3) accepts the invitation.\n\nInshort, User2 became the Team Manager of a Team which he didn't intend to join in the first place.Also due to the fact that he is now a Team Manager, he cannot leave the Team as there isn't anyone else as Team Manager in the Team. \n\n\nI still believe that by the above method, an attacker was still able to control the victim to do an unwanted operation on his hackerone handle..","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-03-09T09:28:30.817Z","updated_at":"2015-03-09T09:28:30.817Z","actor":{"username":"h122-","cleared":false,"url":"/h122-","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":348891,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Let me also quote 2 more defects which you have identified that may cause bad UX but still rewarded the bounty.\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/46397\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/48422\n\nIf the above 2 defects qualified for the bounty, then the same shall me applied for mine as I had shown 1 possible exploit and not just simply bad user experience.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-03-09T09:33:53.356Z","updated_at":"2015-03-09T09:33:53.356Z","actor":{"username":"h122-","cleared":false,"url":"/h122-","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":349063,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Updates?
