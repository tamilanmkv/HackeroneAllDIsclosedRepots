I have done so for the sake of a good POC,  but the registration process is slow. I will comment on this issue when the POC is live.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n0. Wait for the POC to be live (registration of my .ma domain is in progress)\n1. Browse to my POC running on https://app-sj17.ma/marketo/post2.html (note that this is literally the POC written by @adac95)\n2. Note the malicous redirect is still successfully executed;\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could be able to execute JavaScript in the context of the www.hackerone.com application, if the victim user makes use of a browser which does not support CSP. The attacker could also perform a limited phishing attack in Firefox or Microsoft Edge.","bounty_amount":"565.0","formatted_bounty":"$565","weakness":{"id":63,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - DOM"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-06-02T17:53:39.938Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-74466774.16725016,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":100,"voters":["kyy","karma7","cdl","vavkamil","hg_real","hunter","base_64","sameerphad72","spam404","mik317","and 90 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.1,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":6,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://www.hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4188773,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @honoki,\n\nThanks for your submission.
