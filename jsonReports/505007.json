These projects contain build files that indicate that some of these projects are resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This allows these artifacts to be potentially MITMed to maliciously compromise them and infect the build artifacts that are produced. Additionally, if any of these JARs or other dependencies were compromised, any developers or production servers using these could continue to be infected past updating to fix this.\n\n**Description:**\n\nThis attack leverages the build infrastructure loading dependencies over HTTP without any other sort of integrity check to allow them to be maliciously compromised.\n\n### This isn't just theoretical\nPOC code has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file inflight.\nSee:\n* https://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/\n* https://github.com/mveytsman/dilettante\n\n### MITM Attacks Increasingly Common\nSee:\n* https://serverfault.com/a/153065\n* https://security.stackexchange.com/a/12050\n* [Comcast continues to inject its own code into websites you visit](https://thenextweb.com/insights/2017/12/11/comcast-continues-to-inject-its-own-code-into-websites-you-visit/#) (over HTTP)\n\n### Source Locations\n\n#### Insecure Download\n\n##### Scrooge\n  - https://github.com/twitter/scrooge/blob/b8fb8b563cb152b5d46c2ec8a24c9c134cdde140/project/plugins.sbt#L1-L6\n \n##### Tormentia\n - https://github.com/twitter/tormenta/blob/50cf4773fd188a6ae82ab87e306a58c064cced1e/project/plugins.sbt#L1-L3\n\n##### Scalding\n - https://github.com/twitter/scalding/blob/19429900e9fcdaa5c38160f0b68b579aac3f4604/project/plugins.sbt#L1-L7\n\n##### Diffy\n - https://github.com/twitter/diffy/blob/7894459430d27d184d3663e0570f535a93fa61c6/project/plugins.sbt#L3\n\n##### Bijection\n - https://github.com/twitter/bijection/blob/11c8325bb734bb3bd36d8d7ac6dd1dd48d82f7e3/project/plugins.sbt#L2\n\n##### Algebird\n - https://github.com/twitter/algebird/blob/01f989f4ad534c1450ab0982669393ba1817a6d1/project/plugins.sbt#L1-L5\n\n##### Hdfs-Du\n - https://github.com/twitter/hdfs-du/blob/5caaa0cf117ed1ebbe873ec1e8302a535bd0bc5d/pom.xml#L64-L75\n\n##### Iago\n - https://github.com/twitter/iago/blob/019a4adfbfa913e6307cdc5a589089e95cfb6285/examples/echo/pom.xml#L17-L28\n\n##### Ambrose\n- https://github.com/twitter/ambrose/blob/da7bcb932c418c157d9c372a4ca5f1884b874d78/cascading/pom.xml#L14-L19\n- https://github.com/twitter/ambrose/blob/da7bcb932c418c157d9c372a4ca5f1884b874d78/scalding/pom.xml#L22-L27\n\n###### BookKeeper\n - https://github.com/twitter/bookkeeper/blob/91c85ab8350dfc00c2bc07f0bed338ce4d87b2f6/bookkeeper-stats-providers/twitter-finagle-provider/pom.xml#L48-L53\n\n###### Elephant-Bird\n\n- https://github.com/twitter/elephant-bird/blob/62642c935198aa0ff968f48669c7e654b42dfbf0/cascading3/pom.xml#L13-L18\n\n###### JOAuth\n- https://github.com/twitter/joauth/blob/b4f6afb6be79ecb0bb8d04c76b17cfa51de4ffab/project/plugins/Plugins.scala#L10-L16\n\n###### Ect...\n\nThis list is not exaustive, I just wanted to come up with examples so the Twitter security team could get a general sense of what they are looking for.\n\nHere are the GitHub queries I used to find these:\n - [SBT Builds with Resolvers over HTTP](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Atwitter+resolvers+http%3A%2F%2F\u0026type=Code)\n - [Maven POM files with Repositories over HTTP](https://github.com/search?l=Maven+POM\u0026p=2\u0026q=org%3Atwitter+repositories+http%3A%2F%2F\u0026type=Code)\n\n**WARNING!** If any of these builds are using a shared or reused `~/.gradle`, `~/.m2` or whatever SBT uses as an artifact cache between builds and any of these downloads were maliciously compromised, the compromised jar may remain inside of cache directory and continue to be used in future builds.\n\n### Fix and Public Disclosure\n\nAt a minimum, all of these code locations where artifacts are downloaded from an untrusted source needs to be fixed. Previous releases should be rebuilt with the fix applied. The checksum of the released artifacts and artifacts built in a trusted environment should be made. If the checksums match, you can be certain that they weren't compromised.\n\nIf the checksums don't match, indicating a compromised artifact, CVE numbers need to be issued for the potentially malicious artifacts.\n\nThe ability to check if checksums match assume that these projects have [reproducible builds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds).\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Cone the Impacted Project\n  2. Change this line in Dilettante so it is targeting the repository used in the build.\n       https://github.com/mveytsman/dilettante/blob/master/dilettante.py#L143\n  3. Start Dilettante on your local machine.\n  4. Proxy the HTTP traffic for the build through Dilettante\n  5. Execute the Build's tests.\n  6. You should be greeted with the image of a cat.\n\n\n## Other Places to Look\n\nGiven how widely I'm finding this vulnerablity externally to Twitter, I'd advise that the Twitter Security team take some time to also analize their internal infrastructure for similar vulnerabilities.\n\n**This responsible disclosure follows [Google's 90-day vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/) (I'm not an employee of Google, I just like their policy).**\n\n## Impact\n\nBy insecurely downloading code over an untrusted connection HTTP and executing the untrusted code inside of these JAR files as part of the unit/integration tests before a release opens these artifacts up to being maliciously compromised.\n\nRemote code execution on a production server. Malicious compromise of build artifacts.","bounty_amount":"280.0","formatted_bounty":"$280","weakness":{"id":32,"name":"Cryptographic Issues - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-12-20T19:04:47.680Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-57096147.14635822,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":9,"voters":["base_64","sameerphad72","prophet","jlleitschuh","abdulsec","cryptographer","dolph1n","neo00","thepalerider"],"severity":{"rating":"high","score":8.1,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":1062,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.twitter.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4271641,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your report @jlleitschuh.\n\nWe are evaluating the behavior that you described and will get back to you when we have more information.\n\nThank you for thinking of Twitter security.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-03-07T00:11:15.607Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T00:11:15.607Z","actor":{"username":"bugtriage-alex","cleared":false,"url":"/bugtriage-alex","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4319180,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report.

If all of the security teams that I've reported this to have fixed before then, I'll go public sooner. I'm more than happy to keep you and your team in the loop on this so we can coordinate publications. \n\u003e \n\u003e However, If any of the organizations that I've been in contact with finds evidence of malicious compromise in their artifacts, I'll need to push the deadline to a 7-day disclosure window and inform all the parties involved. If this vulnerability is being actively exploited maliciously it means it has become a Zero-Day.\n\nI'm currently coordinating the public disclosure of this vulnerability with at least two other organizations (coordinated CVE and blog post releases).\n\n## Larger Scala \u0026 SBT Ecosystem\n\nAs Twitter is a large corporate entity that heavily relies upon SBT/Scala, I'm going to rope you in a bit more on the larger industry issue I'm encountering.\n\nI've been in contact with [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com/scala)'s security team. Lightbend is  the corporate entity backing Scala and SBT. I've informed them that the builds for SBT core, several official SBT plugins, and a few of the Scala core libraries are vulnerable to this.\n\nLightbend's security team has acknowledged the vulnerability and said that they will work on fixing it. However, they don't have the resources to audit previous releases to see if any of them were maliciously compromised.\n\nThis is from the Lightbend security team:\n\u003e I don't think auditing all previous releases is necessary, not without any evidence that we may have been targeted.\n\u003e We're a small company whose teams are already very stretched - we don't even have a full time team working on sbt. We need to spend our resources wisely, and doing an audit with no evidence that it's necessary is not feasible for us.\n\nGiven that some of these projects are used to build or are dependencies of the Scala compiler if any of these previous artifacts were compromised, they could have been used to maliciously compromise a previous compiler in such a way that the only way to detect the compromise is to audit the bytecode in the compiler. Such an attack could be used to compromise future compilers.\nThis is called the \"Trusting Trust\" attack:\nhttps://www.archive.ece.cmu.edu/~ganger/712.fall02/papers/p761-thompson.pdf\n\nDuring the Snowden Revelations, we learned about project Strawhorse, a CIA project to malicious compromise the XCode compiler: https://edwardsnowden.com/2015/03/10/strawhorse-attacking-the-macos-and-ios-software-development-kit/\n\nWe've also seen that a malicious version of the XCode compiler was created by Chinese hackers.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XcodeGhost\n\nMy point is that this isn't outside the realm of possibility, nor the capability of large state actors (or a malicious ISP).\n\n## Plea to Twitter\n\nI'm a single researcher doing this research as a part time project while also working a full time job.\n\nI also don't have the resources to perform audits of previous releases of SBT and Scala's compiler. If the Twitter security team thinks that the possibility of compromise for SBT or the Scala Compiler is a valid concern, it would be incredible if Twitter could invest the resources to validate that SBT and the Scala compiler haven't been maliciously compromised by this attack vector.\n\nIf there is interest, I'm happy to CC someone from the Twitter security team into the ongoing email conversation I'm having with Lightbend.\n\nIf this is beyond what Twitter is capable of supporting, I also understand. I just feel like I have a moral obligation to ask for assistance with a problem that I can't solve alone.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-03-15T20:33:58.890Z","updated_at":"2019-03-15T20:33:58.890Z","actor":{"username":"jlleitschuh","cleared":false,"url":"/jlleitschuh","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/388/267/887b2ef55debfc7b243bdf563d314329cf750468_original.JPG/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4451551,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Just wanted to check in to see if the Twitter Security team had any updates.\n\nI just want to give you a heads up that, barring any show-stopping incidents, I plan to go public with this story about this industry-wide vulnerability on June 10th, 2019 or as close to that as possible.\n\nThanks,\nJonathan Leitschuh","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-04-02T20:05:48.973Z","updated_at":"2019-04-02T20:05:48.973Z","actor":{"username":"jlleitschuh","cleared":false,"url":"/jlleitschuh","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/388/267/887b2ef55debfc7b243bdf563d314329cf750468_original.JPG/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4661984,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi all,\n\nJust checking in on the progress resolving this issue fully across twitter.\n\nFor example, joauth hasn't been resolved yet:\n\n- https://github.com/twitter/joauth/blob/b4f6afb6be79ecb0bb8d04c76b17cfa51de4ffab/project/plugins/Plugins.scala#L10-L16\n\nAlso, will the Twitter security team handle filing for the CVE numbers for these projects or should I do that once this issue is resolved?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-04-29T14:23:28.916Z","updated_at":"2019-04-29T14:23:28.916Z","actor":{"username":"jlleitschuh","cleared":false,"url":"/jlleitschuh","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/388/267/887b2ef55debfc7b243bdf563d314329cf750468_original.JPG/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4665311,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@jlleitschuh  - Hi!
