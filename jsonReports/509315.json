The attack requires poisoned XML configuration data to make to the component's client code. I may have held off on reporting it, but the maintainer did acknowledge a similar attack, twas XXE, under CVE-2018-20433. Since the reporter didn't dispute it, I decided to report this attack as valid as well.\n\nVulnerabilities like these exist because https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/xml/parsers/DocumentBuilderFactory.html#setExpandEntityReferences(boolean) is a poorly named and documented method thus causing misunderstanding.\n\nI'm on my third five hour energy today.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis could be leveraged by an attacker to cause a Denial of Service by crashing the JVM that the server process is running on.","weakness":{"id":96,"name":"XML Entity Expansion"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-05-16T20:02:18.263Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-75927944.41769402,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["eveeez","cryptographer","defheckler","tescoramen"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":6.2,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"local","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"none","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":17122,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"Java Component in search.maven.org","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4318467,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your submission.
