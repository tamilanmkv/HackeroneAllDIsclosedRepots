At fault is the `wp_targeted_link_rel()` filter that parses attributes regardless of their position.\n\n```\nfunction wp_targeted_link_rel( $text ) {\n\t// Don't run (more expensive) regex if no links with targets.\n\tif ( stripos( $text, 'target' ) !== false \u0026\u0026 stripos( $text, '\u003ca ' ) !== false ) {\n\t\t$text = preg_replace_callback( '|\u003ca\\s([^\u003e]*target\\s*=[^\u003e]*)\u003e|i', 'wp_targeted_link_rel_callback', $text );\n\t}\n```\n\nIt essentially just parses the attribute string of all `\u003ca\u003e` tags and passes them to the preg replace callback.\n\n```\nfunction wp_targeted_link_rel_callback( $matches ) {\n\t$link_html = $matches[1];\n\t$rel_match = array();\n...\n// Value with delimiters, spaces around are optional.\n\t$attr_regex = '|rel\\s*=\\s*?(\\\\\\\\{0,1}[\"\\'])(.*?)\\\\1|i';\n\tpreg_match( $attr_regex, $link_html, $rel_match );\n\n\tif ( empty( $rel_match[0] ) ) {\n\t\t// No delimiters, try with a single value and spaces, because `rel =  va\"lue` is totally fine...\n\t\t$attr_regex = '|rel\\s*=(\\s*)([^\\s]*)|i';\n\t\tpreg_match( $attr_regex, $link_html, $rel_match );\n\t}\n```\n\nAs can be seen it then uses a regex to parse the `rel` attribute, its value and its delimeter from the string.\n\nIf the rel attribute is found, the following happens:\n\n```\n\n\tif ( ! empty( $rel_match[0] ) ) {\n\t\t$parts     = preg_split( '|\\s+|', strtolower( $rel_match[2] ) );\n\t\t$parts     = array_map( 'esc_attr', $parts );\n\t\t$needed    = explode( ' ', $rel );\n\t\t$parts     = array_unique( array_merge( $parts, $needed ) );\n\t\t$delimiter = trim( $rel_match[1] ) ? $rel_match[1] : '\"';\n\t\t$rel       = 'rel=' . $delimiter . trim( implode( ' ', $parts ) ) . $delimiter;\n\t\t$link_html = str_replace( $rel_match[0], $rel, $link_html );\n```\n\nAs you can see the value of the `rel` attribute is splitted by whitespaces and each part is then escaped. The targeted `rel` value is then added to the alread existing ones and put back together.\n\nMost importantly, are the following line:\n\n```\n\t\t$delimiter = trim( $rel_match[1] ) ? $rel_match[1] : '\"';\n\t\t$rel       = 'rel=' . $delimiter . trim( implode( ' ', $parts ) ) . $delimiter;\n\t\t$link_html = str_replace( $rel_match[0], $rel, $link_html );\n```\nif the delimeter is empty (e.g. when `rel=abc` has no quotes), the delimer becomes  `\"`. The original rel attribute is then replaced with the new one. \n\nThis is a problem since the following payload:\n\n`\u003ca title=\"  target='xyz'  rel=abc \"\u003ePoC\u003c/a\u003e`\n\nwould turn into\n\n`\u003ca title=\" target='xyz' rel=\"abc\" \"\u003ePoC\u003c/a\u003e` Note that an additional `\"` has been injected and the title attribute has been escaped.\n\nThis is because the regex to match the rel attribute ignores the position of the `rel` attribute within the attribute string. The above payload shows how the rel attribute is placed within a double quoted attribute. Since no delimeter is set, the delimer becomes a double quote and when the rel attribute is inserted back into the string, the double quote is injected.\n\nI recommend using something like `parse_shortcode_atts()` as in `wp_rel_nofollow()` to prevent this from happening.\n\nBy abusing the attribute injection, it is easily possible to create a Stored XSS payload. \n\nTge `wp_targeted_link_rel()` filter is not only called on the user description, however, this is where it becomes exploitable. This is because this vulnerable filter is added before the `kses` filters are added, which means that the injected attribute would be caught by `wp_post_kses()`. The user description is the only exception where the kses filters are called before `wp_targeted_link_rel()` is called.\n\n`\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\" target='abc' rel= onmouseover=alert(/XSS/) \"\u003eThis is a PoC for a Stored XSS\u003c/a\u003e`\n\n\n## Proof of Concept\n\nThe following will demonstrate how a normal forum user can achieve stored XSS on their profile page in BuddyPress\n████████\n\n1. This works if the Bio of forum users is displayed in their profile page. Log in as an administrator and go to Appearence -\u003e Customize and then BuddyPress Nouveu -\u003e Member front page and make sure that displaying the user bio is enabled\n\n2. Create a normal forum user account\n3. Login and edit your profile. Paste \n`\u003ca href=\"#\" title=\" target='abc' rel= onmouseover=alert(/XSS/) \"\u003eThis is a PoC for a Stored XSS\u003c/a\u003e` as your user description\n4. visit your profil and hover over the link.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe Impact of this can vary from site to site. I have shown how this can be exploited in BuddyPress as a mere, normal forum user. Since you can also inject a style attribute and make the link span over the entire page, one can turn this into a wormable Stored XSS in BuddyPress.\n\nBasically every plugin or forum is affected that displays the user description.","bounty_amount":"650.0","formatted_bounty":"$650","weakness":{"id":62,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-02-02T23:02:01.985Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-53280364.74380196,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":80,"voters":["thaivu","foobar7","mashoud1122","simonscannell","sameerphad72","bibekshah","ali","0xelkomy","b3hlull","aryan2808","and 70 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":2750,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"WordPress Core","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4370008,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks for the report, we're currently testing a patch for the issue and will keep you updated with any developments.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-03-21T23:16:29.893Z","updated_at":"2019-03-21T23:16:29.893Z","actor":{"username":"vortfu","cleared":false,"url":"/vortfu","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/982/1ef285fb263d30f189dc6a8038e1d5c46086e9d9_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpress","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4910299,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"████ ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-05-23T13:43:28.991Z","updated_at":"2020-01-08T16:15:01.751Z","actor":{"username":"simonscannell","cleared":false,"url":"/simonscannell","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/HvE5FGgP56eXFMNMr4rwmunu/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpress","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6345943,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @vortfu ,\n\nAre there any updates on the patch?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-19T14:01:29.206Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T14:01:29.206Z","actor":{"username":"simonscannell","cleared":false,"url":"/simonscannell","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/HvE5FGgP56eXFMNMr4rwmunu/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpress","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6352337,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @simonscannell,\n\nWe put together this patch that aims to fix this problem.
