Before the patch was deployed, the controller action would dispatch the request to a class that handles authorization, input validation, and business logic. This class would receive an array of report IDs. The authorization check would pass when the user was signed in. The class would dispatch the call to a separate class to collect all the information for the CSV export based on the given report IDs. This class would make an intersection between the given report IDs and the reports the signed in user has access to. Up until the introduction of Custom Fields, this was not a problem because the CSV structure was the same for every program. Passing report IDs that a user wouldn't have access to would result in an empty CSV being returned.\n\nWith the introduction of Custom Fields, additional headers would be added based on the report IDs. We incorrectly assumed that the class had already made sure that the report IDs were authorized, which wasn't the case. This caused a minor security vulnerability where the IDs of Custom Field Attributes were leaked. The fix added a proper authorization check in the class that the request is initially dispatched to. The diff (without additional specs) can be seen below. Requesting a report to be exported that the user doesn't have access to will now result in an error instead of an empty CSV.\n\n```diff\n--- a/app/backend/interactors/reports/export.rb\n+++ b/app/backend/interactors/reports/export.rb\n@@ -10,7 +10,12 @@ module Interactors\n       private\n\n       def authorized?\n-        authenticated?\n+        return false unless current_user\n+\n+        team_ids = Team.joins(:reports).where(reports: { id: report_ids }).ids\n+        membership_ids = current_user.team_ids\n+\n+        (team_ids -
