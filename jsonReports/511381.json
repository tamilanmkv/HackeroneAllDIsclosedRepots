(e.g.: Labels/Broadcast Messages)\nAll those functions are vulnerable to ReDoS.\nIt seems that there is a problem with the [regex](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/app/validators/color_validator.rb#L15) in [app\\validators\\color_validator.rb](https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/app/validators/color_validator.rb) to validate a specified color code.\nAn attacker can exhaust the server's CPU with this vulnerability, and cause a continuous DoS.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Create a project.\n2. Go to `http(s)://{GitLab Host}/{userid}/{Project Name}/labels/new`.\n3. Fill out `Title` form with `PoC`.\n4. Click `Create label` button.\n5. Intercept the request.\n6. Change the value of the parameter of `label%5Bcolor%5D` to `#0...(50000 times)c0ffee`.\n7. Forward the request.\n\nResult: Can not access to GitLab service. (CPU usage rate of the server had risen to over 90%.)\n\nNote: If the attacker sends requests continuously, DoS will be continuous.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n[Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS - OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS)\n\n## Impact\n\nAll users will not be able to access the entire GitLab service.","bounty_amount":"1000.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,000","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial of Service"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":50,"voters":["foobar7","mashoud1122","gotha","base_64","s_p_q_r","mik317","ali","myasnikovalexey","eren","mansoor0x01","and 40 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18138,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"gitlab.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4342494,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @8ayac,\n\nThank you for submitting this report.
