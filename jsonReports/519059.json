Log in to an account with unprotected tweets on the Android app.\n  1. Log in to the same account on mobile.twitter.com and turn on protected tweets.\n  1. Confirm that the account's tweets are protected.\n  1. In the Android app, go to the Direct Messages tab, click the gear icon and change a setting such as \"Receive message requests\" or \"Show read receipts.\"\n  1. The account's tweets are now unprotected.\n\nIf this does not work, you may have to first explicitly unset the protected tweets setting in the Android app before setting it elsewhere.\n\n## Impact:\n\nThis can cause a user's tweets to unknowingly become public. It is possible this could be exploited by an attacker asking the user to change their settings but that is less likely to succeed than with the previous bug where only changing the email address was required.\n\n## Impact\n\nSee above.","bounty_amount":"560.0","formatted_bounty":"$560","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-05-30T13:45:37.913Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-74740995.75373363,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":16,"voters":["dhakal_ananda","ali","apapedulimu","ecx","wayc0de","cr4xerbik4sh","cryptographer","tunget","taco2sday","bondiola","and 6 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":2.5,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"local","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":1068,"asset_type":"GOOGLE_PLAY_APP_ID","asset_identifier":"com.twitter.android","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4425589,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I forgot to set the \"Weakness\" and I can't seem to be able to edit it now, I think it should be Privacy Violation.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-03-30T14:00:35.506Z","updated_at":"2019-03-30T14:00:50.550Z","actor":{"username":"nyuszika7h","cleared":false,"url":"/nyuszika7h","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4435012,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your report @nyuszika7h \n\nWe were able to reproduce the behavior in your report and will get back to you when we have more information\nPlease note, in our tests we were only able to reproduce this behavior when the victims Twitter app explicitly turned off protected Tweets, and it was re-enabled in `mobile.twitter.com`.
