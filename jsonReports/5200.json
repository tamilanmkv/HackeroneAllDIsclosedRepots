They had not acknowledged that this flaw allowed for user enumeration and hence I am posting the report again - in hope of a proper and well evaluated response.\r\n\r\nThe key security issue however, is that after x amount of email addresses are sent requests for money (rate limiting issue, using coinbase email for spam), the users which are members of coinbase can be differentiated between non-members.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there is further information disclosure, as the first and last name of the coinbase users email address is also disclosed.\r\n\r\nHence I believe the following impacts are:\r\n\r\n1. Unlimited money request emails, spam\r\n\r\n2. Email Address / User enumeration on Coinbase\r\n\r\n3. Information Disclosure of Coinbase Accounts (First and Last name)\r\n\r\n    Steps to reproduce the issue or a proof of concept\r\n\r\nTo reproduce the vulnerability:\r\n\r\n1. Login to Coinbase.\r\n\r\n2. Visit https://coinbase.com/transactions\r\n\r\n3. Click the Request Money button at the top\r\n\r\n4. In the from field, insert a coinbase user accounts email address: e.g. ntsoneq@gmail.com\r\n\r\n5. The rest of the fields can be entered in as usual\r\n\r\n6. Click the Request Money button\r\n\r\n7. In this stage, capture the request using a proxy, e.g. Burp Suite\r\n\r\n8.

Allowing lists to be invoiced is core functionality of our service. Furthermore, it's not necessary to use \"Burp Suite Intruder\" in the manner demonstrated here. The functionality is exposed more directly in an intentional fashion over our API: \n\nhttps://coinbase.com/api/doc/1.0/transactions/request_money.html\n\nThis process simply sends an email with a request. It does not initiate any bitcoin transfer without confirmation from the recipient, and would not be any more effective than more traditional phishing methods, which we spend a considerable amount of time preventing.\n\n# Email Address / User enumeration on Coinbase\n\nWe've spent a good amount of time investigating this behavior and we believe that the risks are incredibly minor. It is an important component in providing a positive user experience in any application. This stance is not unusual on the web: you'll find that user enumeration is possible on Facebook, Google, and nearly every other major internet site. In Coinbase's example, it's absolutely critical that we're able to notify our users when they attempt to request bitcoins from an invalid email address.\n\n# Information Disclosure of Coinbase Accounts (First and Last name)\n\nWe do not require a name to register with Coinbase. For individuals who have decided to list an optional name, our product and [Privacy Policy](https://coinbase.com/legal/privacy) make it explicitly clear that this contact information will be shared.\n\n\u003e To process your payments, ... Your contact information, date of sign-up, the number of payments you have received from verified Coinbase users, and whether you have verified control of a bank account are provided to other Coinbase users who you transact with through Coinbase.\n\nThanks again for your submission and we apologize for the delay in responding to this report. We were not interacting with you until we fully transitioned over to this new platform. We don’t expect delays as significant as you experienced to happen again.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-03-31T21:24:29.481Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T21:24:29.481Z","actor":{"username":"magoo","cleared":false,"url":"/magoo","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/044/c5a0272bf5bace329125da5217384d22c444edb3_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"coinbase","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":21923,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-03-31T21:24:29.624Z","updated_at":"2014-03-31T21:24:29.624Z","actor":{"username":"magoo","cleared":false,"url":"/magoo","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/044/c5a0272bf5bace329125da5217384d22c444edb3_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"coinbase","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":22344,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"More information can be found here: \n\nhttp://blog.coinbase.com/post/81407694500/update-on-coinbase-data-security","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-04-01T18:45:43.772Z","updated_at":"2014-04-01T18:45:43.772Z","actor":{"username":"magoo","cleared":false,"url":"/magoo","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/044/c5a0272bf5bace329125da5217384d22c444edb3_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"coinbase","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
