As a result, even if a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw exists, and a user accidentally accesses a link that exploits this flaw, the browser  will not reveal the cookie to a third party.If HTTPOnly flaf is missing, As a result, the cookie (typically your session cookie) becomes vulnerable to theft of modification by malicious script.This may allow an attacker to get the cookie information using XSS attacks. The majority of XSS attacks target theft of session cookies. A server could help mitigate this issue by setting the HTTPOnly flag on a cookie it creates, indicating the cookie should not be accessible on the client.\r\n\r\n\r\nIam listing down the cookies which are missing the HTTPOnly flag...\r\n• __cfduid \r\n• request_method \r\n• return_to\r\n• _cb_cookie_test \r\n\r\nwant to know more about httponly flag...\r\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly...","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-04-30T00:52:35.164Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-235145783.7836572,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":21415,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Hi kuramsai - \n\nThanks for your submission.
