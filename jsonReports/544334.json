This time I discovered a way to tekeover any user's account via unsafe password reset.\nThis time it's much easier than #1 way in the #543678 report.\nWhen users requests the password reset, the next link is come to the email:\n```\nhttps://█████/resetpassword.aspx?ru=[user_id]\u0026op=[token]\n```\nThe [user_id] is numeric, always same for same emaill, and incremental for every new user.\nThe [token] parameter is random and used to protect the link from hijacking.\nBut, I discovered that Reset password endpoint accepts empty token!\n\nSo all the attacker needs, it's to initiate password reset for the victim's email, and request the\n```\nhttps://██████████/resetpassword.aspx?ru=[user_id]\u0026op=\n```\nSince `[user_id]` is numeric and static for same account, it can be easily guessed by the attacker.\n\n##POC\n1) Go to the https://█████/ForgotPassword.aspx\n2) Initiate reset password for the `██████` (it's my test account)\n3) Use this link:\n```\nhttps://███/resetpassword.aspx?ru=7655\u0026op=\n```\nwhere 7655 - it's my user numeric ID (as we know, it's incremental, and be easily guessed for other accounts).\n██████████\n4) Set the new password and confirm it. You can set something as `111111111aA!!!!` to pass the password requirements.\n5) You will be logged into my organization as admin.\n\n##Suggested fix\nFix the `op` tooken validation - it should be checked properly.\n\n## Impact\n\nSeverity: Critical\nImmediate account Individual/Cprporate account takeover via password reset.
