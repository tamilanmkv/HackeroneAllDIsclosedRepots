Create a dropbox account\r\n2. Create a folder\r\n3. Invite victim to collaborate with new folder ([instructions](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/19)).\r\n4. Create a file called test.html within the folder with the contents below.\r\n\r\n    \u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert(document.domain);\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e\r\n\r\nFor victim to run the exploit, they need to take the following steps\r\n\r\n1. Accept invitation to collaborate\r\n2. Open shared folder, select the file test.html (not to preview, just to the side of the name, so that you can do next step).\r\n3. Above file listings, the option \"Previous versions\" should be available, click on that\r\n4. Click on the vulnerable version, it should open a URL such as https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/sharedfoldername/test.html?some unique parameters\r\n5. Observe XSS alert (would be more malicious in practise). Note that the domain is dl-web.dropbox.domain, which is included in the bounty brief as *.dropbox.com\r\n\r\nNote that you don't *need* to share the folder, the original user can see the exploit, but would be considered Self-XSS, so the sharing is needed to make this attack possible on other drop box users.\r\n\r\nNote that any filetype that would be rendered by the browser and can run scripts is fine, such as svg, xhtml, etc.\r\n\r\nIf requested, I can make a screencast and/or screenshots of this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time in reading this report, please let me know if you have any questions or clarifications needed.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHugh","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-05-16T23:31:39.936Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-202145984.00307316,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":382719,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Hi Hugh\n\nThanks for reporting.

I would have thought it could be a reasonable scenario to have an existing shared folder with legitimate content in it, then change then delete (so user would click on previous version thus get XSS).\n\nYou don't need to do anything special to open it in a separate tab also, just a normal click worked for me (on the version history page). I can give a screencast/screenshot to clarify if you think I'm looking at a different place.\n\nIf you truly believe that this is a wont fix, would you be able to update the bounty brief to outline that you won't award bounties on the web-dl domain if they require too many (2, 1 from a legitimate dropbox page) user clicks. Otherwise other researchers may be wasting time looking for things that seem valid by your current bounty then get rejected.
