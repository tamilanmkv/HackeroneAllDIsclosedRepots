There's a possible password reset token leakage on the password reset page. \r\n\r\n###Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Go to https://app.c2fo.com/password-reset and request a new password (with your existing test account)\r\n2. Click on the password reset link which you'll receive via email\r\n\r\nThe url bar should look like that: ```https://app.c2fo.com/password/reset/XXXX0de607bdbc2df949a7da49fabcfXXXXX```\r\n\r\nSo far so good.  You should see the logo of \"Truste certified blabla\" at the bottom. \r\n\r\nThe logo is linked to the following url: ```https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Pollen,-Inc-/validation?rid=46f28cc9-128f-431a-8fff-6d19427150d9```. \r\n\r\nAs you can see it's a link from a \"https\" page to a \"https\" url. That means that the referrer will be send to the target. That means that the password reset token will be leaked to the \"truste\"-company through the referrer.\r\n\r\nClicking on the logo should send the following request (including the referrer):\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /privacy-seal/Pollen,-Inc-/validation?rid=46f28cc9-128f-431a-8fff-6d19427150d9 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: privacy.truste.com\r\n[...snip...]\r\nReferer: https://app.c2fo.com/password/reset/XXXX0de607bdbc2df949a7da49fabcfXXXXX\r\n[...snip...]\r\nConnection: keep-alive\r\n```\r\n\r\nA bad boy webmaster at the \"truste\"-company could collect the reset urls/token from the access.log.\r\n\r\n###How to fix\r\nI'd recommend to either remove the logo from this particular page or remove the link to the third-party company. \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSebastian","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-05-14T20:44:54.669Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-233864791.59877592,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":25299,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for submitting this vulnerability.
