Then, only project members should have access to the pipeline information. \n\nHowever, this can be bypassed. There is a internal endpoint (`:namespace/:project_name/merge_requests/:iid/pipeline_status`) on each merge request page allowing anyone with merge request access also view the last pipeline status for this merge request. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a public project, disable public pipelines, and restrict the visibility of pipelines to project members only\n2. Setup the repo such that there is a CI job, and create a merge request\n3. As an unauthorized user, perform the following request in the browser: `https://example.gitlab.com/\u003cnamespace\u003e/\u003cproject\u003e/merge_requests/1/pipeline_status`. This will return a JSON response with a content similar to the one like this leaking the pipeline status:\n\n```\n{\n    \"icon\": \"status_running\",\n    \"text\": \"running\",\n    \"label\": \"running\",\n    \"group\": \"running\",\n    \"tooltip\": \"running\",\n    \"has_details\": false,\n    \"details_path\": \"/test-project/testproject/pipelines/37\",\n    \"illustration\": null,\n    \"favicon\": \"https://example.gitlab.com/assets/ci_favicons/favicon_status_running-9c635b2419a8e1ec991c993061b89cc5aefc0743bb238ecd0c381e7741a70e8c.png\"\n}\n```\n\nThis information is only limited to project members only and thus is leaked to everyone with project and merge request access.\n\n### Impact\n\nUnauthorized users have access to the pipeline status of a merge request.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nAn unauthorized user can make this request and successfully can get information to attached pipelines.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThis request above should return 403 Forbidden, if the user does not have access to view pipelines.\n\n### Output of checks\n\nThis happens on gitlab.com\n\nBest regards,\nXanbanx\n\n## Impact\n\nUnauthorized users have access to the pipeline status of a merge request.","bounty_amount":"750.0","formatted_bounty":"$750","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":9,"voters":["ali","cr4xerbik4sh","cryptographer","grani_soe_gelok_12_joki_padang","hackdwerg","mattini","psf","jasy","7a-69"],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18138,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"gitlab.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4857163,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @xanbanx,\n\nThank you for submitting this report.
