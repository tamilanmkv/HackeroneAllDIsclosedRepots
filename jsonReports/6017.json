You have a 302 redirect from a *.slack.com domain. Hash-values will follow the redirect.\r\n2. The Facebook application OAuth settings are too weak, and a files.slack.com-URL will be accepted as the redirect_uri. You should restrict these to a www.slack.com that then redirects to the subdomain, instead of allowing all *.slack.com-subdomains, or deny the files.slack.com as a OAuth redirect-subdomain.\r\n\r\nSo, the following URL will redirect the user to files.slack.com after authentication of the app (or if the user already has it approved, no client interaction is needed):\r\n\r\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dialog/oauth?client_id=569627156411038\u0026redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffiles.slack.com%2Ffiles-pri%2FT025M9QPZ-F0283NJ20%2Fhash.swf\u0026response_type=token\u0026scope=user_photos\u0026sdk=joey\r\n\r\nI

I suggested a solution where you're able to restrict your app to JS SDK only so the redirect_uri cannot be anything else than Facebooks xd_arbiter.js.\n\nWe'll see what happens there. I think the answer will be a Wontfix to them as the dynamic subdomains (which are added to the request since the page using the JS SDK is on *.slack.com) is the anti pattern according to Facebook. \n\nOne solution would be to host the Facebook-JS on //slack.com which are then utlized by *.slack.com, that would make it possible for you to add a whitelist-redirect_uri on //slack.com so nothing more than JS SDK and that redirect_uri (which then would be something like https://slack.com/404). But that would require you to move out the FB.init code to some sort of iframe-proxy or something, which is pretty ugly.\n\nAnyway, let's see what happens. I'll be in touch.\n\nRegards,\nFrans","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-05-20T20:57:01.063Z","updated_at":"2014-05-20T20:57:01.063Z","actor":{"username":"fransrosen","cleared":true,"url":"/fransrosen","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/001/634/6569f1cff6ac26c01a91db469d8707228965f09f_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":54437,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-05-20T23:08:58.512Z","updated_at":"2014-05-20T23:08:58.512Z","actor":{"username":"iamcal","cleared":false,"url":"/iamcal","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/138/0e164dd6477c48d57f2f5a1c56756f7ec98229cf_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":67024,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi Cal,\n\nI've got an answer from Facebook today, and it's the thing I believed should be the answer. TL;DR, you need to implement the real OAuth-flow when you're dealing with unlimited subdomains. The JS-SDK is impossible to secure when you do not have control over your subdomains.\n\nHere's their answer:\n\n\u003e Hi Frans,\n\u003e \n\u003e The platform engineers I talked to agreed that the situation you laid out (using the JS SDK for a single app on unlimited subdomains without enabling other forms of client auth) isn't well-supported by our current set of configuration settings:\n\u003e \n\u003e - Turning off client-auth also turns off the JS SDK (since it uses an access token)\n\u003e - As you pointed out, adding an explicit OAuth redirect URI works if you have a single domain or a known set of subdomains but not with an unlimited number.\n\u003e \n\u003e At this point there are not any plans to support keeping the JS SDK enabled while disabling other forms of client-auth. In cases where you need to support an unlimited number of subdomains, our recommendation is to use the explicit/code flow, which gives you more control over the application and its interaction with Facebook. You can define a single OAuth redirect endpoint and redirect from there to the appropriate subdomain-specific endpoint.\n\u003e \n\u003e Please let me know if you have any additional questions!\n\u003e \n\u003e Thanks,\n\u003e \n\u003e Neal\n\u003e Security\n\u003e Facebook\n\nRegards,\nFrans","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-05T07:30:15.236Z","updated_at":"2014-06-05T07:30:15.236Z","actor":{"username":"fransrosen","cleared":true,"url":"/fransrosen","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/001/634/6569f1cff6ac26c01a91db469d8707228965f09f_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":67559,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for figuring this out!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-05T21:29:00.828Z","updated_at":"2014-06-05T21:29:00.828Z","actor":{"username":"iamcal","cleared":false,"url":"/iamcal","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/138/0e164dd6477c48d57f2f5a1c56756f7ec98229cf_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":177122,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Thanks again for reporting this (and the followup).
