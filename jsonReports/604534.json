They themselves cannot remove themselves from the group as well as the group leader cannot remove that user from the group. Ofcourse this is a low severity as that malicious user first needs to have a valid invitation link, but nevertheless this leads to permanent membeship of group so this needs to be fixed in my opinion.\n\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nWe need two accounts to reproduce this.\n\n- First account will be leader account\n- Second account will be a normal account.\n\n- Create a group from the first account and create an invitation link.\n- Join using the invitation link on the second account and intercept the request:\n\n```\nPOST /group/post_join HTTP/1.1\nHost: ctf.hacker101.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nReferer: https://ctf.hacker101.com/group/join?invite=bb5c42ab578b12c63e5d868b3e03816c8c45597262aaf095ca2be19116b8fd0a\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 109\nConnection: close\nCookie: COOKIES\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n\ncsrf=391aecf0c3125e90c437d04c18204ab6\u0026invite=bb5c42ab578b12c63e5d868b3e03816c8c45597262aaf095ca2be19116b8fd0a\n```\n\nRepeat the above requests in parallel. I did it for 5 parallel requests and I was able to add myself 2 times to that group:\n{F505223}\n\n- Now try deleting the user from first account(group leader). No matter how much you try, you won't be able to delete it.\n\nThis would lead to a state where the group leader will have to delete the group and create a new group if he wants the malicious user to get removed. \n\nThanks,\nYash\n\n## Impact\n\nIrremovable/permanent member of the group. Even the group leader cannot remove that user.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":105,"name":"Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":505223,"file_name":"Capture.PNG","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/505/223/73af2cbbb72cac409252def9adacbce16026bea9/Capture.PNG?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Capture.PNG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Capture.PNG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQQUWX32YR%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151253Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDI60ST6nG4q4laTSFldIqSXi%2FaRkkQyutm5GwT0cJIZgIhAOZhMg3jBlju6Int%2BeeUm1aiBO7rhlrQcLIk%2Bgf6D%2BEDKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwXNLBv9MILvVoorSoq1wOfX3WD6Q7XyleYeGc645Essao0xgUb9KvTqDMYcvHVGFjpYncM47xpmv3HMsu%2F5W1XrLh7mNNldxl0sp09zO40TE5Gv3tk2fKUJkR%2FD6XSYmqjjSQ1X8rpbrso174vGjaIUSzY97sO%2Fd37gH6ZpB7ew%2Fv3oEvinQIGLVJR0eRzLhiviACbbOMKLVbWbamWcEPt5JM%2BAi%2F9NdNl7YuEpr2x1Aba%2FQ7SrG7ebdm1DcE0lVqIqx0ztrFvl3nirCMo74N6ge1UFzEhWH44%2BFZEehSLzVwe3%2F%2FBZFO65bGyxbdcPGK84GPYyTmQ%2BjLOaldd7KqAdRhPjDfqVNtwC3oWvVdxRnK%2FoQIrzUgaia36mrU%2B9zb4%2FRhBIhVDxcpxUM1gkKjO26kCJizTpuEecHCYqUizMVCu%2BZHsHDBDtIkkSFfQ%2B2gv2sFyQKltKMSVLAEHz02kDaXPYdZgNpJpJb5mig7chRqoJheUFMk5FqS9E%2FlqeZ5JfW22b6sOCLD%2FEMKSDTLFHVl3btbPUCjyHfhmlMXnpBRHVIqKR1wYVgjD5A7%2FSBEWiHu7RrZzNRZghQJBq1L32qmueS8YHqpboqJLILIuPtnLxC99DFuXuovAM4duMqxEoPDhN0Mw3oyRiwY6pAEUCR%2BsNQPvZhxAQDP4H0mmjcS7kJOELluaCLhnFR0avdVxZaYB9x8Q%2B1vVVuMQVfHNSrjWJl4H%2Be5xJlQ6IIY3JmCIpBdpvoYal7a%2B64IuQyPvQqpHA3Ie7oP5I5O%2F9TxjNDzuk8S48F6Uu5xP3VWBG1thWt0Ez9VpERdwmSl9%2FKYIOOCQmgzrHUQhmsthA0Nah76KucMZDyOmhK8c6RFPBq%2BuQw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=f8ad8890e46c750297480c8f417bd01f0677d6df1f257825c2d6c9f3e5d8de7f","file_size":63501,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-04-19T17:00:13.956Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-46649559.44869998,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":116,"voters":["canarinho_pistola","thaivu","msultan","run_win","a_d_a_m","s1r1u5","base_64","emperor","ninetynine","sameerphad72","and 106 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":2.4,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":14424,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://ctf.hacker101.com","max_severity":"low"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5035965,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"A small video demonstrating the report: ████████","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-09T10:29:10.024Z","updated_at":"2020-03-20T17:08:43.263Z","actor":{"username":"yashrs","cleared":true,"url":"/yashrs","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/S9WnJuUrpWvxZ6iM38qL2HE4/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5035968,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"This also affects the statistics of the group, though that's not a big concern.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-09T10:30:43.276Z","updated_at":"2019-06-09T10:30:43.276Z","actor":{"username":"yashrs","cleared":true,"url":"/yashrs","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/S9WnJuUrpWvxZ6iM38qL2HE4/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5042939,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @yashrs,\n\nThank you for your submission.
