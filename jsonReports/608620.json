All you need is a MITM!](https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/want-to-take-over-the-java-ecosystem-all-you-need-is-a-mitm-1fc329d898fb?source=friends_link\u0026sk=3c99970c55a899ad9ef41f126efcde0e)\n\nThis vulnerability impacted the following organizations:\n\n - Apache Foundation (including the Groovy compiler)\n - Eclipse Foundation\n - Pivotal (including many of the Spring projects)\n - RedHat\n - Jenkins\n - JetBrains (including the Kotlin compiler)\n - Gradle\n - PayPal\n - Netflix\n - Twitter\n - PortSwigger\n - Elastic\n- Grails\n\nIt also impacted some of the most popular JVM libraries including: \n - TestNG\n - PowerMock\n - Spock\n - Ehcache\n - Hibernate\n\nThe list of projects I publicly disclosed the details of this vulnerability to on GitHub during my research can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zemxj8QdIp0saqvwJx6Po1KnyEmJXl2KC_0j0SLd_2E/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Resolution\n\nAs a part of resolving this issue, I also reached out to Sonatype (Maven Central), JFrog (JCenter), Pivotal (Spring Source), RedHat and the Eclipse Foundation to make a plea to them to completely block port 80 (HTTP) download of dependencies by 2020.\n\nAs a direct result of my research [HTTP access to repo1.maven.org and repo.maven.apache.org is being deprecated](https://central.sonatype.org/articles/2019/Apr/30/http-access-to-repo1mavenorg-and-repomavenapacheorg-is-being-deprecated/). That article will be updated shortly with attribution.\n\n# Criteria\n\u003e In addition, vulnerabilities should meet most of the following criteria:\n\n##  Be widespread: vulnerability manifests itself across a wide range of products, or impacts a large number of end users.\n\nThis impacted some of the most popular and most used open source projects across the JVM ecosystem.\n\n## Have critical impact: vulnerability has extreme negative consequences for the general public.\n\nAbsolutely! This vulnerability impacted the supply chain for incredibly popular JVM libraries and 2 compilers. It was incredibly widespread and if it was exploited could have been used to backdoor applications around the world.\n\n## Be novel: vulnerability is new or unusual in an interesting way.\n\nIt's really not novel. That's part of what's sad about this. It's such a simple vulnerability and that it impacted so many projects across the industry was just so disturbing.\n\n# Closing\n\nIf you have any questions or want additional information, please don't hesitate to ask.

To quote from it:\n\n---\n\n## How Common are MITM Attacks?\nMy initial research into how common MITM attacks were actually stemmed from my research into maliciously compromising XML parsers that loaded DTD files loaded over HTTP in order to achieve XXE. More on this topic in a future writeup. What I found was quite alarming.\n\n### Internet Service Providers\nTo my surprise, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) seem to be doing this quite regularly.\n\n\u003e Comcast began injecting 400+ lines of JavaScript code in to pages I requested on the internet so that when the browser renders the web page, the JavaScript generates a pop up trying to up-sell me a new modem.\n\u003e \\- [Comcast continues to inject its own code into websites you visit](https://thenextweb.com/insights/2017/12/11/comcast-continues-to-inject-its-own-code-into-websites-you-visit/)\n\nBharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) an ISP in India also has a history of injecting Ads into their user’s webpages when those pages are loaded over HTTP.\n\nThis indicates that the infrastructure already exists and could be re-targeted to impact JAR files.\n\n### Malicious Actors\n When malicious actors gain access to a system, they often quickly utilize their new foothold to establish a MITM. Every year, Verizon releases a Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) which analyzes the various attack vectors that were most commonly exploited each year. This is a quote from one of their reports.\n\n\u003e ## Actions\n\u003e The top three threat action categories were Hacking, Malware, and Social. The most common types of hacking actions used were the use of stolen login credentials, exploiting backdoors, and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\u003e \\- [Verizon 2011 Data Breach Investigations Report; Page 69](https://www.verizonenterprise.com/resources/reports/rp_data-breach-investigations-report-2011_en_xg.pdf)\n\nTo quote from the analysis from this report:\n\n\u003e I infer that it’s a secondary action used once somebody has a foothold in the system, but the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit’s data says it’s quite credible for concern. Of the 32 data breaches that made up their statistics, 15 involved MITM actions.\n\u003e \\- [Answer: Stack Exchange: Are “man in the middle” attacks extremely rare?\nMITM attacks should be considered a credible threat in software security.](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/12050)\n\n### Over a Public WiFi Connection\nSetting aside all of these other attack vectors, any developer working on any of these projects over a public WiFi connection has opened up their computer to the potential for malicious compromise. This attack was demonstrated with the famous Firefox plugin Firesheep.\n\n### Governments\nDue to the Snowden Revelations, we now understand the various methodologies used by the US Government’s three letter agencies to perform MITM attacks against US citizens.\n\n\u003e To trick targets into visiting a FoxAcid server, the NSA relies on its secret partnerships with US telecoms companies. As part of the Turmoil system, the NSA places secret servers, codenamed Quantum, at key places on the Internet backbone. This placement ensures that they can react faster than other websites can. By exploiting that speed difference, these servers can impersonate a visited website to the target before the legitimate website can respond, thereby tricking the target’s browser to visit a Foxacid server.\n\\- [How the NSA Attacks Tor/Firefox Users With QUANTUM and FOXACID](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/10/how_the_nsa_att.html)\n\nThere has also been a history of internet traffic being routed through foreign countries due to [misconfigured BGP routes](https://www.wired.com/story/google-internet-traffic-china-russia-rerouted/).\n\n---\n\nThe reason that this vulnerability is important is because one well placed MITM attack against a library could be leveraged to maliciously compromise hundreds or thousands of downstream users.\n\nIf you disagree that MITM attacks are a credible threat, then I understand and will respectfully bow out and close this report.\n\nI'm 100% not going to argue that this attack is novel. It really isn't. However given the potential impact of the vulnerability and the number of projects and organizations impacted, it would be foolish to assume that someone in a privileged network position and with a target in mind wouldn't want to take advantage of this attack vector to poison the supply chain.\n\nPlease remember that the Android ecosystem is 100% reliant upon the supply chain security of the Java Ecosystem. Infect the right JAR file, you can potentially infect the phones of some part of the over 2 billion android users. If that doesn't paint a target on the back of the JVM ecosystem, I don't know what does.\n\nCheers,\nJonathan Leitschuh\n\n\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-12T18:42:44.817Z","updated_at":"2019-06-12T18:50:52.757Z","actor":{"username":"jlleitschuh","cleared":false,"url":"/jlleitschuh","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/388/267/887b2ef55debfc7b243bdf563d314329cf750468_original.JPG/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5073907,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @jlleitschuh,\n\nI agree completely with you on this being an impactful bug, I am just unsure of the practicality of it being exploited in the wild, due to the difficulty of targeting/setup for the MiTM position and injection of custom, malicious code on the fly.\n\nI'll pass this on to the team as is for determination, but if you could answer how easy/difficult this would actually be to exploit in practice, it may help your case.

Since most of the Java ecosystem is using primarily either Maven or Gradle as build tools, and neither of these tools do checksumming for verification (there are plugins but they are never used). Adding checksumming by default is something Gradle is actively working on especially after this report. Both Maven and Gradle rely on exactly the same protocol for uploading/downloading JAR files from these artifact servers. Thus, any attack would be applicable to both.\n\n*Note: I've attached an image from a survey of Java developers asking what build tools the use. This data comes from the [JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2019/java/)*\n\n#POC\n\nA proof of concept for performing this MITM  and infecting JAR files on the fly has existed since **2014**:\nHere's the blog post from Max who originally reported this problem back in 2014:\nhttps://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/\nHere's the GitHub repository with the POC code:\nhttps://github.com/mveytsman/dilettante\n\nUnlike Max, I actually went out and did the legwork to get many of these impacted organizations to actually fix the problem by responsibly disclosing where relevant, or creating a public issue where there was no corporate entity to contact. I've also been pushing these artifact hosts to drop support for HTTP to totally mitigate this vulnerability once and for all.\n\nAny attacker who has a MITM position could craft their specific payload and any jar would be immediately infected. After that, as I describe in my companion piece [Let’s write a (theoretical) Java Library Worm](https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/lets-write-a-theoretical-java-library-worm-9a6edff87cf5?source=friends_link\u0026sk=26453ca39076ac327c259f7a84355752) I describe how the Java build infrastructure like Maven and Gradle works and how such an attack could be leveraged.\n\nWriting the worm I describe in the link above is completely within the capabilities of probably ~90% of all software developers with at least 2 years experience with the Java language. I know I could certainly have written it in probably a week. However, for ethical reasons I chose not to. The real challenge of the malware/worm author would be writing it in such a way that the exploit keeps itself hidden, but that's generally the problem of RCE vulnerabilities or wormable exploits and is not exclusive to this specific case.\n\n---\n\nI'm sorry I didn't include all this information in my original post.\n\nIf there's a general expectation that the information in a report should be 100% encapsulated inside of what is sent to HackerOne and should not rely upon external resources like blog posts that fully detail the public disclosure of the vulnerability, that would be valuable information on the homepage for this bounty program.\nIf the full disclosure blog post wasn't clear, that's on me, I'm sorry for not being clear enough there.\n\nThanks,\nJonathan

The IBB should proactively identify software that has a gap in rewards for vulnerability research; in conjunction with other criteria, this is a good indicator that the software should be moved into
