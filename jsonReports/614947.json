Below is more detailed video explaining possible causes of your reproducing difficulties.\n\nP.S.: Please do not pay attention to that I use the browserstack instead of real IE browser. The security settings are default and I've tested this at 2 different real Windows 10 with the latest IE, the behavior remains strongly the same. \n\nP.P.S.: Please make sure you serve the PoC under some internet-domain if you use your own PoC. It doesn't work if you save the PoC into HTML-file and open it from disk, I think it is because fo some IE protection from interaction between **intra**net and **inter**net.\n\nPlease let me know if you need more assistance.\n{F516164}\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-24T22:38:02.800Z","updated_at":"2019-06-24T22:38:02.800Z","actor":{"username":"skavans","cleared":true,"url":"/skavans","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/014/089/00a08f6b566bcdfe82b2f0be62bdde605a030823_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"attachments":[{"id":516164,"filename":"nr_clickjacking_full.mp4","type":"video/mp4","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/516/164/f5270de8ea216cfa221d4436690e9db6ee973e77/nr_clickjacking_full.mp4?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22nr_clickjacking_full.mp4%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27nr_clickjacking_full.mp4\u0026response-content-type=video%2Fmp4\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQSWVBQGJF%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151303Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIDKFbNpVUzrOPbUQYjhN4DgAxVU5%2FXEKmVfjCMWb%2BNkIAiABDuahSBdMUCytEahxX048K6jzH7PGdOzEr8bjHNv10CqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMFF93LkCZvrkmcBNoKtcDT4JSiF4LJ9dMlVWVXz6ozMkun%2BZIV%2FnNB6qVpNI4VDOdAc06QNZffMvjZwfupMjaAHpuIYcvqlkda6prO9SWrglyS6NCrBHv2gaT40jgHA6ufjwtH7OxGYsx039h%2Bh8lmcb39NUtDqetz1GDVn0P%2BUNi77DW4gUN5GnzWQsten34H99dGqb8t6pYxCQN%2F8DKWHJ%2BalzRH5DiTjmpYvgNaPu2xwo%2F6Zr8S4tdff1lzr%2BcSt%2FZceeJJnqd2Z9QEAJO7SqjLAnxMOiEuHPHYVOEZ3kfA%2B%2Bbt34tKfFC8MGX%2BXh1zYwal1wOrSP2k%2FZSlC9lsLebNN7Iooim1lSpjw7Du5GV89O7g%2F7rGROCUF%2B%2BB24LrVSbZTIggbHns1VxsRvSvZGmJHi7XvmhECvDwu9WmRNJs7XWIMzDD0fOHc22lsbafqmlkdZqwRzJhStehJfZCskFpe6v4wdnRFJqrnSW1n3s9Cn28vHMBxxweBr72n7tIeDBX4PMTrrfy%2B5OhLDCrxYOtKZndzmZHfMzTm0b0uMHvqjv6rofYcR42du%2BPYJ87HhllMZGstEyOaYDwXJ6mUAWqgFU1cRtr5KgJU%2BjBFYZrWtE%2BoZkvuXgEXg40jlw%2BeRQEreWMOGKkYsGOqYBYdUdmtOC7YWorffY3XWIt13STuNB47ZWJ85D8q%2F8hMPTVw3x9BFRZcvFy7ieSMolt4GYUK%2F8moEzkTt%2FanjYuLBUJFMJFunxOEvaMPJA128lGEkS1qX60D7%2BiOofrwvOesADqaqm%2FmYvf6HgURng7sqkiLxzy3mjSpM33Soz6mVH2tmMNYspiP4BF%2BNbXdXLCjYBsB98ENZjOy3b4d4U9P8NkvkUag%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=5a5667f637ccde3a372ef14690f19c62d7bc582f71f95cbab7e118ef7ebf1f90"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"newrelic","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5184973,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@skavans I appreciate you working through this with me.

It's actually less than 1% of traffic and we don't plan on continuing that support.\n(2) On top of that, this relies on social engineering.
