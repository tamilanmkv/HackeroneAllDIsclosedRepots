The access is only allowed if the protocol, port and also the domain match exactly.\n \nHere is an example, the URLs below all belong to the same origin as http://site.com :        \nhttp://site.com\nhttp://site.com/\nhttp://site.com/my/page.html\n\n\nWhereas the URLs mentioned below aren't from the same origin as http://site.com :          \nhttp://www.site.com  (a sub domain)\nhttp://site.org            (different top level domain)\nhttps://site.com         (different protocol)\nhttp://site.com:8080  (different port)\n\n\nWhen the sandbox attribute is set, the iframe content is treated as being from a unique origin, even if its hostname, port and protocol match exactly. Additionally, sandboxed content is re-hosted in the browser with the following restrictions:\n\nAny kind of plugin, such as ActiveX, Flash, or Silverlight will be disabled for the iframe. \nForms are disabled. The hosted content is not allowed to make forms post back to any target. \nScripts are disabled. JavaScript is disabled and will not execute. \nLinks to other browsing contexts are disabled. An anchor tag targeting different browser levels will not execute. \nUnique origin treatment. All content is treated under a unique origin. The content is not able to traverse the DOM or read cookie information. \n\nWhen the sandbox attribute is not set or not configured correctly, your application might be at risk.\n\nA compromised website that is loaded in such an insecure iframe might affect the parent web application. These are just a few examples of how such an insecure frame might affect its parent:\nIt might trick the user into supplying a username and password to the site loaded inside the iframe. \nIt might navigate the parent window to a phishing page. \nIt might execute untrusted code. \nIt could show a popup, appearing to come from the parent site. \n\nSandbox containing a value of :\nallow-same-origin will not treat it as a unique origin. \nallow-top-navigation will allow code in the iframe to navigate the parent somewhere else, e.g. by changing parent.location. \nallow-forms will allow form submissions from inside the iframe. \nallow-popups will allow popups. \nallow-scripts will allow malicious script execution however it won't allow to create popups.","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":1,"voters":["sameerphad72"],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18844,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/curl/curl","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5301549,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @kazemusic1337, \n\nThank you for the report!
