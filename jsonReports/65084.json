I though i would do the right thing and report it and hopefully i can get a very nice bounty for this.\n\n\nEXPLENATION:\n\nAlright so the exploit is basically around btc vault when withdrawing, after the withdraw gets cleared (before completion) it gets credited to your wallet since i used my mobile after that i was able to spend my btc freely from my wallet since the withdrawn was never completed, it was just cleared. after i spent all the btc from my wallet i just cancelled my withdrawn and it got credited back to vault and my wallet balance turned into negative. then after that i would normally be able to create another wallet and withdraw or just close my account and get all the btc from the vault. which i have already spent meaning i would be duplicating the amount of coins i have, then i would just repeat by creating another account and doing everything on repeat. This can be fixed easily by crediting the bitcoins to the wallet only after completion of withdraw, not only clearance.\n\n\n\nHopefully i explained everything in detail and i did the right thing to report this and hopefully i can get a very good bounty from you guys. I have always respected coinbaseâ€™s work. I will also include some screenshots as attachments in this email.\n\n\n\n\nThanks,  \n\nDavid
