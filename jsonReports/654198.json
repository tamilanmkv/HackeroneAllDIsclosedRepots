Assume that you are not invited to [███████](https://hackerone.com/██████████) private program private program, first step, use the publish feature, go here: https://hackerone.com/hacktivity/publish\n2. Submit a publish report, put ████████ (███████) in Program (see below), put any test details and hit `Publish Vulnerability`.\n████\n3. Now the vulnerability is under `Pending review` by a moderator\n4. Send a test mail to `hackerone@████.com` to get an invitation to submit a report, accept the invitation and you will become a participant of the said private program.\n5. After that you will observed after how many hours, it will show on the private program hacktivity page your publish report will show as `resolved` ███████ and displayed on their hacktivity timeline, this will also show on your hacker profile time line ███. \n\n## Additional PoC below:\n\n████\n\nThe report number of that publish report is https://hackerone.com/reports/652941 , __please note that this test publish report is still under pending review by the moderator.\n\n## Impact\n\nHacker can manipulate the private program hacktivity page to show his/her hackerone name to look like there is so many report that was submitted and resolved.\n\nThis will also manipulate the hacker profile to show that he/she have many report that was submitted and resolved to a particular private program.\n\nAudience for that hacker will be tricked.\n\nLet me know if you need additional information.\n\nRegards\nJapz","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-10-27T22:23:54.560Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-61750278.227780074,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":201,"voters":["al-madjus","primeministerofcats","wi11","env","d0kkillo","mashoud1122","base_64","0xbeefed","sameerphad72","spam404","and 191 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.4,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5395200,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportTitleUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-07-23T02:37:06.027Z","updated_at":"2019-07-23T02:37:06.027Z","additional_data":{"old_title":"Manipulate hacker profile and private pogram hacktivity to expose your name as researchers who is actively submitting reports with resolve status","new_title":"Manipulate hacker profile and private program hacktivity to expose your name as researchers who is actively submitting reports with resolve status"},"actor":{"username":"japz","cleared":false,"url":"/japz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/078/347/38b576ad263c5255e136ebbd3a19eb61ff7a298d_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5395449,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Another thing is, the [██████████](https://hackerone.com/████) submit report button is currently disabled, means they are taking a break and not accepting submissions, __But__ still i can manipulate their hacktivity timeline to show/flood it with my name showing i have a resolved reports despite they are taking a break and not accepting submissions.
