So, if you are not able to reproduce let me know i will send you a video to help reproduce the issue.\r\n\r\nReproduction Steps :\r\n1) Let's say you are User A who is inviting a user B to abug report, User A goes to + sign(adding participants) and adds a email address there.\r\n2) User B gets an email immediately about an invitation, he accepts it and sees the bug report.\r\n3) User A after few minutes of sending invitations realizes he made a mistake in email, and cancels the invitation which is still showing pending in his side. \r\n4) User A is shown a message \" The invitation to UserB has been successfully rejected.\", he thinks now the User B is not able to see the bug report anymore. But to his expectation, User B can still see the bug report.\r\n\r\nSo what is happening?\r\nWhen User A clicked on the cancel sign to invitation that showed \"pending\", the cancel signed only made the invitation send to email invalid. But since user B has already accepted the invitation, User A's clicking on him won't remove User B from the bug report.\r\n\r\nSo what should have actually happened?\r\nWhen User A clicked on cancel sign to invitation that was showing \"pending\", it should check if the user B has already join the bug report or not. And if User B hasn't it should make invitation code invalid, and if User B has already accepted and joined the Bug report, it should revoke the User B's access from Bug report.\r\n\r\nI hope this clear enough to understand.\r\n","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-08-08T23:19:37.596Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-194889354.91837737,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":442850,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Hi @batman,\n\nI can see what you're attempting to do; however, I am unable to reproduce the issue using the provided steps. Specifically:\n\n_Discrepancy 1:_\nIn your step 4, you mention getting a confirmation message about successful rejection of the invitation. After User B has accepted the invite, having User A click `Cancel` on the pending invite instead results in a `404 Not Found` response and a `Page not found` error page. See my attached screenshot for reference.\n\n_Discrepancy 2:_\n\u003e When User A clicked on the cancel sign to invitation that showed \"pending\", the cancel signed only made the invitation send to email invalid.\nI'm not sure I fully understand what you meant here, but no email should be generated by clicking `Cancel` on the pending invitation.\n\nGiven the behavior I am seeing, there shouldn't be any confusion where User A ends up thinking User B has been declined access to the team. If User A sees the error page and goes back to the User Management page, User B will now be listed under the members list and can be removed using the `Remove` link.\n\nIf you feel this is incorrect, please do provide a video of the workflow and any additional data (like request/response data) that could be helpful in reproducing the issue.
