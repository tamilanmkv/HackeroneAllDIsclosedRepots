This is not really preventable.\n\n\u003e Also our long term vision is anyway that a project with an item you have access to will grant you the same permissions for all other items in this project.\n\n\u003e For now I think this is okay, because at least you can not iterate over all projects anymore, to gather a list of all public shared talk conversations.\n\nI'm not so sure about this. I don't think a user sharing a public file to a private discussion would expect that this will leak the private discussion title to all users that have access to the file. \n\nI could think of two potential solutions here:\n\n- (at least if it's a private conversation) ask the user to name the project themselves and make it clear that this name may be shared with anyone who has access to any resource in the project.\n- only show projects to a user if the user has access to all elements in the project\n\n(Silently) giving a user access to all items in a project once they have access to one item doesn't seem ideal. If you plan on making an explicit permission model for projects, that could be a different thing, but I'm not sure it would necessarily solve this problem. \n\nBest,\nFoobar7\n\nPS: You can credit me as Tim Coen (https://security-consulting.icu/)\nPPS: Thanks for the bounty and the swag!
