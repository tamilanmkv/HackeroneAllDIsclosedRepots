All the attacker needs to do is bruteforce the simple **ID** which surprisingly is a randomly generated number( I personally think it's based on the time and it later gets converted using a epoch converter). What makes it worse it that, that particular endpoint doesn't even check for proper implementation of **Authorization Header**.\n\n## Steps to reproduce:\n* On the attacker's device, intercept all the requests using **Burpsuite**.\n* Send an attachment from the victim's account to the attacker's account.\n* In the **Burpsuite's**  log you'll come across a request something similar to this:\n\n```\n\nGET /attachments/938540538 HTTP/1.1\nX-Signal-Agent: OWA\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Client-Version: BCM Android/5.1 Model/generic_Google_Nexus_6 Version/1.26.0 Build/1393 Area/200 Lang/en\nHost: ameim.bs2dl.yy.com\nConnection: close\nUser-Agent: okhttp/3.12.0\n\n```\n\n* Over here the ID number `938540538` will be different for each attachment.\n* Put this particular request the repeater tab and change the ID value to `359912920` (which was sent to some other person).\n* This is what it should look like: {F548523}\n* You can even try it out by removing the `Authorization` Header completely and still the attacker will end up getting the attachment.\n\n## PoC:\n\n* Have a look at the video over here: {F548509}\n\n## Impact\n\nGetting access to all the attachments uploaded by any user.","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design
