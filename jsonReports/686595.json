Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request.\n    2. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data. \n\n**Description:**\n\n## Impact\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. From the Search Center of █████████ for example  [https://www.███/Home/Search?searchDomain=flagship\u0026tag=1%20mlg]\n2. By Searching for \"alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--%0D%0A%3E%3C/SCRIPT%3E%22%3E%27%3E%3CSCRIPT%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))%3C/SCRIPT%3E\u0026redirect=%27%3Balert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//%27%3Balert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//%22%3B%0D%0Aalert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//%22%3Balert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//--%0D%0A%3E%3C/SCRIPT%3E%22%3E%27%3E%3CSCRIPT%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))%3C/SCRIPT%3E\u0026token=%27%3Balert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//%27%3Balert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//%22%3B%0D%0Aalert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))//%22;\"\n3.

Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser.","weakness":{"id":61,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":3,"voters":["zayn1337","mrkalibot","l4rryc0013r"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5714816,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
