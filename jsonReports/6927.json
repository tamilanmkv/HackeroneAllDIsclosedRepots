An attacker could exploit this issue by (for example) tricking a user into clicking on a link to a page with the following HTML code:\r\n\r\n    \u003cimg src=\"http://www.irccloud.com\"\u003e\r\n\r\nWhen the user visits the page, the browser will send a request to www.irccloud.com, over an unencrypted connection (note the **http** instead of **https**), containing the session cookie. When this happens, an attacker can easily take over the user's session with a *Man-In-The-Middle attack*.\r\n\r\nI recommend setting the Secure flag, so browsers who support the Secure flag will prevent the transmission of a cookie in an unencrypted HTTP packet.","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-05-15T16:20:06.711Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-233794687.96625292,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":28567,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks very much for your report!\n\nWe've taken a look into this and it is a bug which our internal security processes had already identified.
