Please analyse the problem until 04.12.2019, otherwise I will report the problem to the people of heise.de. \n\nIn my opinion it's a serious bug because administrators rely on nextcloud to control the content of files by mime type. But it doesn't, internally the mime types are converted to file extensions. \n\nAn attacker can rename a malicious file with a permitted extension and file access control has been tricked.\n\nI convinced the decision makers in our company to use nextcloud, now there are accusations because we cannot use nextcloud because of the problems mentioned above.\n\nHow can I prevent certain file types from being uploaded (based on mime types)?\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-27T18:58:13.291Z","updated_at":"2019-11-27T18:58:13.291Z","actor":{"username":"teaport","cleared":false,"url":"/teaport","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"nextcloud","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6428659,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @teaport \n\nwe analysed the problem already.
