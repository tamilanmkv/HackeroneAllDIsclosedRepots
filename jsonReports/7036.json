This file stores the user's authenticated session identifier. Stealing this information would allow unauthorised access to a user's account.\r\n\r\nThe content of the file can be seen in the file attached to this report.\r\n\r\nThis file is accessible from the phone even while the phone is locked with a passcode suggesting that the application does not secure the file using the appropriate data protection class.\r\n\r\nThis can also be verified by using the tool available at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/ciso/ios-dataprotection/\r\n\r\nIf a user is logged into the application, all that an attacker needs to do is surreptitiously take the phone and dump the file within the folder. This would work while the phone is locked and does not require the phone to be jailbroken.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that I haven't looked through all the files, but any sensitive file with the Protection class set to anything other than NSFileProtectionComplete would be extractable from the iPhone without requiring the passcode.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to test this, you can use the ios-data protection tool mentioned above or extract the data with iExplorer (Demo version) while the phone is locked and the user logged in.\r\n\r\nMore information regarding data protection is available here:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/AdvancedAppTricks/AdvancedAppTricks.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH7-SW24","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":6179,"file_name":"iOS-unauthorised_access.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/006/179/d3c500b720e9a8f220892cf18adb69282ff5239c/iOS-unauthorised_access.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22iOS-unauthorised_access.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27iOS-unauthorised_access.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQY53K44OC%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151855Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQCU8ZTbZzS6KdrG%2BJrTZNy82bTqU%2FWXOWwT7y6tP8B6KAIgQozKTGEEU%2F70E9jK8ee9qFehhPTHAyr6tKNPFg0ipagqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDF24qMO4iM3lRhiKeSrXA3AD62arZ%2FR73I3OwVYKSQCLgGLmSdy1oHr3484T3%2BZNdRf9jASNKtWoD4ND1FsQM%2BH%2FxYbuyUfVW1RfHyrPNSyl31UWmh7%2FQLuSlKjidHFofUO6MlDrn8WL5H8Dklkc%2FODNXnwWhhBS4P4ETpaL0O2W1uk1mywZuHYi%2FHdUzHz3D04j6CIFX8koOXulelg3aywpppZ%2BEQtc5UJl3%2FFtSaZhFImaUXkZ%2BzfEI%2BbQZR9YL2QECzdM3wSFAU88f993HARvk3jnLnZu%2FeEflruySV3ucsnDUFOGStl4Z92w7SWYAu4eDkreiVsqtuAq5AUa5%2BxAlO8ntiuuW%2F1ub33RDrVP%2F1fK0GljO09wOd0GggTt7eJg%2FThXb0E0vNvuwPp1jdadEeVnZq2BNBCkROzc7bkLv3NE%2FYGkeq2tXA2h%2FEIK8ch9Mnp6UiGfyxWGAmVSXsYjBfrEAhj%2FOjyT96V663zm4TqRAN1sBiDSBG2V62BD69wu%2BKoIKDUGczZoq%2FV0i7T2Z94gjXG54fv8Q9pYpQYidhIS8cWbi1UAeyC7clfpue5hvais0Jt95MyKeSs9D4lwBmMR0UyOP2rP66bKUJXZxm09UaueyC8QE1RefPMEnNlod%2FEZhzCfjpGLBjqlAXGztZxISzkOSBi8ODZQNabZwzSDol%2BJUpM4q3e6PNJ%2FgMEC3ZQgjfp1kkwqPmzwlsAYYdaiUyY63ZSo5cIUxwTYMNXkbtuqxJrWDNMFnO8tISB8THjfP1XKNdJ7hpjx0Bx9mhmB9FifH5ih2c0AvGKyBC0fFcEdB0xLEnh5UcS8oUuRyx81oqTUXuBHWiT8%2B9GXMeEJa92HZXoXratnwKl2tc9yww%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=ee53ce182b8c1e82edafcbaa736ba63b502aa3598f5ae907308a4a9bdb2f3fd9","file_size":56900,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-05-15T14:16:29.085Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-233802146.46868065,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":3,"voters":["sw33tlie","cryptographer","mohamed_salah"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":30847,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"You might want to address this issue as this is a serious vulnerability in the iOS application.
