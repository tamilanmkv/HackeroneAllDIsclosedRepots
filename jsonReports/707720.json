Please let me know if it is not.\n\n## Proof of Concept:\n\n\t[code]javascript://%0dalert%28document.cookie%29[/code]\n\nThis creates a link with the `javascript:` pseudo-protocol that can be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript when clicked. The vulnerability is actually with the regular expression used to match and auto-link URLs within the code block:\n\n\t/\\w+:\\/\\/[\\w-.\\/?%\u0026=:@;#]*/g\n\nIn the version of SyntaxHighlighter that comes bundled in the open-source plugin, the regex is:\n\n\t/\u0026lt;\\w+:\\/\\/[\\w-.\\/?%\u0026=@:;]*\u0026gt;|\\w+:\\/\\/[\\w-.\\/?%\u0026=@:;]*/g\n\nThe `\\w+` character class part of `\\w+:\\/\\/` is too loose IMO. I would recommend modifying the regex to match a whitelist of protocols similar to what KSES does within WordPress, or disable auto-linking within SyntaxHighlighter.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Visit https://mattstestsite128160580.wordpress.com/2019/10/03/test-post/ in Firefox or Chrome.\n1. Submit `[code]javascript://%0dalert%28document.cookie%29[/code]` as a comment.\n1. Click the `javascript://` portion of the rendered highlighted code.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript as the victim user's account with the security context of the \u003csite\u003e.wordpress.com domain.","bounty_amount":"350.0","formatted_bounty":"$350","weakness":{"id":62,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-11-09T17:03:58.009Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-60646512.47888374,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":114,"voters":["poutine_hero","sameerphad72","v0lck3r","spam404","sh1yo","mik317","dhakal_ananda","enixium","ronr","sudi","and 104 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":4.7,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5960277,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi.
