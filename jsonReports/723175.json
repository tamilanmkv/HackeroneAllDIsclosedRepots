We have been working on analyzing Cross-Site Browser Leaks (xsleaks) and building a tool for finding instances of it on target web sites. Recently we tested imgur.com and discovered a flaw that can affect Imgur users. We would like to responsibly disclose it and support you to mitigate the issue. The details follow.\n\n## Attack Overview:\nEvents-Fired xsLeak: a cross-domain attack website, say attacker.org, could embed specific resources from imgur.com in a script Tag, and check if an error or load event is triggered in one state but not in the other. \nBased on which events are triggered for each vulnerable resource, the attacker can infer the victim state (e.g. logged in vs logged out, or owner of a specific profile). This happens because the leaky endpoint return a 2xx HTTP response in one state but a 4xx in the other.\n\nIn particular, we have found 2 vulnerable (leaky) endpoints:\n\n1. The first one can be used for login detection (onerror =  logged out, onload = logged in):https://api.imgur.com/3/larynx/history?IMGURPLATFORM=web\u0026IMGURUIDJAFO=9d77969d8b3a7a6ac6cb78943c96e48cd0bd74e02b29839f9f19aea827429db6\u0026SESSIONCOUNT=3\u0026client_id=546c25a59c58ad7\n\n2.  The second one can be used to track and deanonymize the owner of a Imgur profile across origins. For this, the attacker leverages the resource: https://\u003cUSERNAME\u003e.imgur.com/all  where \u003cUSERNAME\u003e is the username of  the victim to be fingerprinted (e.g., https://user1imdea.imgur.com/all). \nIf the victim visiting the attack page is the owner of the \u003cUSERNAME\u003e profile, the \"onload\" event will be triggered. Otherwise, the \"onerror\" event is fired.\n\n## How to reproduce the attack:\na. We have attached a PoC attack page.\nb. Acting as the victim, login to imgur.com from a browser and load the attached page in a different tab of the same browser.c. Specify the profile/home page url of format:  https://\u003cUSERNAME\u003e.imgur.com/all  for the target victim in the input field, and press the submit button.\nc. After a couple of seconds, popups should appear saying whether you are logged at imgur and if you are the owner of the specified account.\n\n\n## Browser/OS tested: \nWe tested the PoC on windows 10 in:  Chrome Version: 77.0.3865.120 (Official Build) (64-bit) and Firefox 67.0.3  (Official Build) (64-bit). The same attack should work on other browsers and OSes too, although we haven't verified it thoroughly!\n\n## Similarity with known attacks:\nSimilar attacks were reported in the past against Facebook (https://www.imperva.com/blog/facebook-privacy-bug/) and Twitter (https://hackerone.com/reports/329957) and the vendors have taken the necessary preventive measures.\n\nFor any further questions, we are available at your disposal.\n\n## Impact\n\n## Impact of the attack\nThe attack enables malicious web sites of the internet to uniquely determine if any of their visitors is logged at Imgur, and also to track and fingerprint Imgur users across origins who have shared particular images. ","bounty_amount":"250.0","formatted_bounty":"$250","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":618318,"file_name":"imgur_attack_page.html","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pCVZYXbWjYWvXk8PV5EvEkSe?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22imgur_attack_page.html%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27imgur_attack_page.html\u0026response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQSWVBQGJF%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T152021Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIDKFbNpVUzrOPbUQYjhN4DgAxVU5%2FXEKmVfjCMWb%2BNkIAiABDuahSBdMUCytEahxX048K6jzH7PGdOzEr8bjHNv10CqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMFF93LkCZvrkmcBNoKtcDT4JSiF4LJ9dMlVWVXz6ozMkun%2BZIV%2FnNB6qVpNI4VDOdAc06QNZffMvjZwfupMjaAHpuIYcvqlkda6prO9SWrglyS6NCrBHv2gaT40jgHA6ufjwtH7OxGYsx039h%2Bh8lmcb39NUtDqetz1GDVn0P%2BUNi77DW4gUN5GnzWQsten34H99dGqb8t6pYxCQN%2F8DKWHJ%2BalzRH5DiTjmpYvgNaPu2xwo%2F6Zr8S4tdff1lzr%2BcSt%2FZceeJJnqd2Z9QEAJO7SqjLAnxMOiEuHPHYVOEZ3kfA%2B%2Bbt34tKfFC8MGX%2BXh1zYwal1wOrSP2k%2FZSlC9lsLebNN7Iooim1lSpjw7Du5GV89O7g%2F7rGROCUF%2B%2BB24LrVSbZTIggbHns1VxsRvSvZGmJHi7XvmhECvDwu9WmRNJs7XWIMzDD0fOHc22lsbafqmlkdZqwRzJhStehJfZCskFpe6v4wdnRFJqrnSW1n3s9Cn28vHMBxxweBr72n7tIeDBX4PMTrrfy%2B5OhLDCrxYOtKZndzmZHfMzTm0b0uMHvqjv6rofYcR42du%2BPYJ87HhllMZGstEyOaYDwXJ6mUAWqgFU1cRtr5KgJU%2BjBFYZrWtE%2BoZkvuXgEXg40jlw%2BeRQEreWMOGKkYsGOqYBYdUdmtOC7YWorffY3XWIt13STuNB47ZWJ85D8q%2F8hMPTVw3x9BFRZcvFy7ieSMolt4GYUK%2F8moEzkTt%2FanjYuLBUJFMJFunxOEvaMPJA128lGEkS1qX60D7%2BiOofrwvOesADqaqm%2FmYvf6HgURng7sqkiLxzy3mjSpM33Soz6mVH2tmMNYspiP4BF%2BNbXdXLCjYBsB98ENZjOy3b4d4U9P8NkvkUag%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=6001d33774e897611b218f8ccbfff242421c1fd7cb035cf3dbaffff13cfb89d9","file_size":1946,"type":"text/html"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-01-05T21:53:01.494Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-55704440.21189195,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":22,"voters":["rootz491","yxw21","sameerphad72","prophet","realtess","g30rg3","zerosin","naategh","khizer47","soheilkhodayari","and 12 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6143331,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello!

I have checked the fix, and I confirm that the second reported endpoint is no longer vulnerable via the Events-Fired XsLeak. The endpoint returns a 2xx response in all states, and seems to be correctly patched. However, the login detection endpoint still seems to be leaky, although it may not be considered security relevant alone.\n\nHaving said that, I noticed that the de-anonymization attack is still possible via another trick (in particular, CSP). While checking the fix, I observed the following behaviour:\n1. when visiting a URL like https://user2imdea.imgur.com/all, the victim is first redirected to https://imgur.com/signin. \n2. Next, if the victim is logged, and her username is anything other than user2imdea, say, user1imdea, she will be redirected to https://user1imdea.imgur.com/all\nSince this redirection is across origin, an attacker can craft an attack page with a suitable content security policy that only allows the three domains: imgur.com/signin, user2imdea.imgur.com and api.imur.com.  Attempting to access any other domain, such as user1imdea.imgur.com, would then trigger a securitypolicyviolation event, by which the attacker can the read the blockedURI attribute from the event, which in turn shows the victim profile address, and thus de-anonymizing the victim.\nI assume this behaviour should in most parts only affect Chrome users.\n\n# Attack steps\n1. Attacker creates a dummy account for herself with profileURL of, e.g., https://user2imdea.imgur.com/all\n2. First a login detection attack is launched\n3. if the user is logged, to deanonymize the victim, the attacker captures content security policy violations (redirections to other domains). To do this:\n\na.  the login endpoint (https://imgur.com/signin) and api endpoint (https://api.imgur.com), as well as the attacker created dummy account (https://user2imdea.imgur.com/all) are placed on the CSP white list\nb. the attacker reads the blockedURI attribute from the securitypolicyviolation event. The blockedURI is the profile address of the logged victim! \n\n\n# Steps to reproduce the attack\nI have provided a PoC attack page for demonstration purposes. \nThe attack page was tested on Chrome 78.0.3904.70 (Official Build) (64-bit).\njust visit the PoC from a logged account in Chrome, and wait for couple of seconds for the pop ups to show up.\n\nIf you have any other questions, do not hesitate to contact me.\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-15T01:13:03.220Z","updated_at":"2019-11-15T01:13:03.220Z","actor":{"username":"soheilkhodayari","cleared":false,"url":"/soheilkhodayari","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"attachments":[{"id":634830,"filename":"imgur_csp_attack_page.html","type":"text/html","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1LJYx64dg1uePjsw65Fp6M5U?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22imgur_csp_attack_page.html%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27imgur_csp_attack_page.html\u0026response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQSWVBQGJF%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T152021Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIDKFbNpVUzrOPbUQYjhN4DgAxVU5%2FXEKmVfjCMWb%2BNkIAiABDuahSBdMUCytEahxX048K6jzH7PGdOzEr8bjHNv10CqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMFF93LkCZvrkmcBNoKtcDT4JSiF4LJ9dMlVWVXz6ozMkun%2BZIV%2FnNB6qVpNI4VDOdAc06QNZffMvjZwfupMjaAHpuIYcvqlkda6prO9SWrglyS6NCrBHv2gaT40jgHA6ufjwtH7OxGYsx039h%2Bh8lmcb39NUtDqetz1GDVn0P%2BUNi77DW4gUN5GnzWQsten34H99dGqb8t6pYxCQN%2F8DKWHJ%2BalzRH5DiTjmpYvgNaPu2xwo%2F6Zr8S4tdff1lzr%2BcSt%2FZceeJJnqd2Z9QEAJO7SqjLAnxMOiEuHPHYVOEZ3kfA%2B%2Bbt34tKfFC8MGX%2BXh1zYwal1wOrSP2k%2FZSlC9lsLebNN7Iooim1lSpjw7Du5GV89O7g%2F7rGROCUF%2B%2BB24LrVSbZTIggbHns1VxsRvSvZGmJHi7XvmhECvDwu9WmRNJs7XWIMzDD0fOHc22lsbafqmlkdZqwRzJhStehJfZCskFpe6v4wdnRFJqrnSW1n3s9Cn28vHMBxxweBr72n7tIeDBX4PMTrrfy%2B5OhLDCrxYOtKZndzmZHfMzTm0b0uMHvqjv6rofYcR42du%2BPYJ87HhllMZGstEyOaYDwXJ6mUAWqgFU1cRtr5KgJU%2BjBFYZrWtE%2BoZkvuXgEXg40jlw%2BeRQEreWMOGKkYsGOqYBYdUdmtOC7YWorffY3XWIt13STuNB47ZWJ85D8q%2F8hMPTVw3x9BFRZcvFy7ieSMolt4GYUK%2F8moEzkTt%2FanjYuLBUJFMJFunxOEvaMPJA128lGEkS1qX60D7%2BiOofrwvOesADqaqm%2FmYvf6HgURng7sqkiLxzy3mjSpM33Soz6mVH2tmMNYspiP4BF%2BNbXdXLCjYBsB98ENZjOy3b4d4U9P8NkvkUag%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=53060f4f162066ba9e378fa18ad0a95d588df516d20dac1f0d7ba7daf0a6b245"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"imgur","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6480861,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@soheilkhodayari,\nWe have deployed another fix for this, can you please take a look?\n\nThanks!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-12-06T09:46:50.279Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T09:46:50.279Z","actor":{"username":"srinidhik","cleared":false,"url":"/srinidhik","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/342/158/8d34a803d2f3fffe842a3047954bcf0007d73044_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"imgur","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6480935,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @srinidhik,\nI confirm that the issues are completely resolved now.  \nThank you!\n ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-12-06T09:59:39.884Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T10:05:16.134Z","actor":{"username":"soheilkhodayari","cleared":false,"url":"/soheilkhodayari","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"imgur","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6485577,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Thanks for helping make Imgur more secure!
