Using alternate channels like password reset emails. \r\n\r\nFor the first way, it can be exploited by poisoning a cache with the attacker's domain and then serving that poisoned response to legitimate users, causing them to redirect to the attacker's domain. This attack kind of varies depending on different web servers as they interpret duplicate Host headers in different ways. The attack vectors are very well explained in the above blogs so I don't want to re-iterate them here again. \r\n\r\nFor the second way, I verified that the password reset functionality on the IRC Cloud website does not retrieve the Host header when sending emails. But, validating the Host header is always a good practice.

It applies to GET requests as well. See attached pic. It might also apply to PUT, DELETE requests if there exists such methods in the application. \n\nI am not sure I understand your reasoning of 302 status and not caching. An attacker can simply send the wrong host in the requests and poison the cache of proxies/web server. It has nothing to do with the browser's cache. \n\nNext time, a legitimate user tries to access the correct host but since the cache of the web server is poisoned with the attacker's domain, the legitimate user will be redirected to the attacker's domain. \n\nAgain, there is no need for CSRF tokens to prevent it from redirecting legitimate users. As seen in the new pic, it affects the first request itself where there is no CSRF token. \n\nI agree that exploiting this is not trivial. It depends on a few factors like the web server and the way it interprets the host header, the ability of attackers to poison the cache, etc. And, it should definitely be fixed.
