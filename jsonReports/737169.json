And you're not allowed to open it until you validate your email address. But by modifying the response , i was able to bypass the email verification.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n  1. Register as a user and signin and try to create a  new email using one of the templates.\n  2. As you can see that you cannot do the above step as you need to verify the email.\n  3. Now logout and again login, bu tnow capture the request in burpsuite and intercept it's response.\n  4. Change the false parameters =\u003e true.\n  5. And the verification is bypassed.\n\n## POC\nRefer to the video attached for detailed steps.\n\n## Impact\n\nThanks, \nAishwarya Kendle","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":633883,"file_name":"Screencast_14-11-19_08_20_02_AM_IST.webm","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/VuqAjyNsVe2VmCWd8wMmGjhX?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Screencast_14-11-19_08_20_02_AM_IST.webm%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Screencast_14-11-19_08_20_02_AM_IST.webm\u0026response-content-type=video%2Fwebm\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQZV3IBMDT%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T152202Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHx%2BIgfH0%2FRLQqbPD5vv6PNps92HY0yneL0kxkNwZHOyAiALrXRJqTvQQGm0xEkYGCB0kbPjUCCkzSeRztvcuetAYyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIM5FTPTB1nK4gXIBLuKtcDHmLbKhsWpyXKgWy1fAYOf0DZEqCEqF9ns7RwihS1bFM9%2BSDXYY0CmIqutWQhK5asoL8jbJZ39%2FJ2eai2SoxTlg3PhjMpNNSUfPFgauwX6vt%2FoeK9VnB1Hmqg6bCNA62qIJPnlTONluGngv604Y6CnYL9Se%2B%2BjgOpqhqmIOX9KlzGAoRM0Ci%2BrWGdELH8Q66bSHmapdLHPWMoGBEj%2BeruK3oCs%2BDaUQ1aE%2FEQ8R5PgqLM3Pq6DrZV9PlFixmkikk8SpDcsFEiT0Zw0gsy2qPz3z3BHAEuG64GguAhIs5FvYP7HbdpPv7rQz4QSDXgN3SIbVD0A4kcV1iNQpZyiw2rmdxuUWIk46d%2FT0u%2B7j9yAdfpDuPVKPDHJD35k0pB6VLe7RtlSwwvcDUa7LL6FJxvOPpupIMPSy51BJl9%2Bf8022a6pcy263zeRDGJjALAc6brW%2BvQoDUu%2FQP%2BdxwOLZvXCyyGJp2%2BK86jg8qU%2FLWZ4DVeR3bIO1n7Fw%2B53iFlBIMatC3ZSLlV1J7dSDCk74u6OWvql%2Brvb6q%2Bj8NHQK6luFckQV%2B9okMhTYuNniW3sHS8rjyNrrGhP8vMtxMzink9EL%2FmU0Oxusg2wmaXCDfIKpDDmspvZQv8MJ%2F%2FkIsGOqYBaz2hfRV48KDU0Mx0UomuXdEWK6oszm51EnI%2FeSepVmINgIWWggB7gENawN0rgfpMSIqQjB%2BpErtoDw1jNWaknZlAG9GLkCZ49lNHNirjr7iPk7LouunUzSZjaag8Yc19L8BAWjyLZnHXpqUZQRBSoqOcAoct3F46M7AzK2ewXHmh7aKY3cfAQTu9yVTJd2CDpuLtlyUDUa37BJ8%2F84puzgJS34jmeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=20786085bcfdbc79f274a60fc793b5dc0359ee5e9388d65bfe4c76fabe90971d","file_size":4441015,"type":"video/webm"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":17,"voters":["sameerphad72","prophet","dhakal_ananda","realtess","r3y","masonhck357","dastan_9408","mrsinister15","cryptographer","rutik346","and 7 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":38702,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"my.stripo.email","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6305093,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hello @aishkendle \n\nThanks a lot for this report and for your contribution to improving the security of our app.\n\nI have created the task for our developers to solve this issue asap.\n\nI will keep you updated on this issue.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-14T13:13:13.034Z","updated_at":"2019-11-14T13:13:13.034Z","actor":{"username":"dkulaksyz","cleared":false,"url":"/dkulaksyz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/S3TPxR7pmh7Mxu2XaqmxrKpz/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"stripo","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6343185,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @aishkendle ,\n\ncan you suggest some mitigation methods for the mentioned vulnerability?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-19T08:30:25.657Z","updated_at":"2019-11-19T08:30:25.657Z","actor":{"username":"artem_nefedov","cleared":false,"url":"/artem_nefedov","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"stripo","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6352685,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"You can restrict the user to open the \"Create Email \" page from the serverside itself by sending an invalid response.\nWhat is happening here is that the content is already present on the client and only a boolean value is used to determine the verification.
