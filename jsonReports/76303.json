I've sent the following email to support@hackerone.com:\n\nSubject: more control over glory?\n\n\u003e Greetings!\n\u003e\nWe've just completed and have requested publication of [our first bug](https://hackerone.com/reports/76303) on HackerOne. The platform is great! In fact, we've decided to make HackerOne our primary security queue.\n\u003e\nHowever, we're having a couple issues with recognizing researchers.\n\u003e\nFirst, we have decided to maintain our old email-based program as a legacy system, and to file bugs received via email over on HackerOne. This means that one of our security team—in the presenting case, me—is credited with the report instead of the original researcher. Our [policy](http://inside.gratipay.com/howto/handle-security-issues) calls for inviting the researcher to join HackerOne if they haven't already, but I'm not seeing a way that we can reassign recognition to them instead of us.\n\u003e\nSecond, we'd like to recognize *all* researchers that contribute to a report, not just the first. In the presenting case, we had a second researcher who was reporting the same basic vulnerability but provided helpful additional information. We'd like to encourage collaboration amongst researchers who are willing to work with us, and to that end we'd like to recognize multiple contributors to a single bug.\n\u003e\nIt seems that these issues could be addressed if we had more direct control over the process of recognizing researchers. Is that a possibility?\n\u003e\nThanks! :-)","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-07-23T12:10:36.413Z","updated_at":"2015-07-23T12:10:36.413Z","actor":{"username":"whit537","cleared":false,"url":"/whit537","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/034/094/b38b9225fd8592d05d5e6939116e8f30d7c98af5_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":522490,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"From @hammad on #76300:\n\n\u003e You requested public disclosure for #76303 which i do not want to disclose.

I'm looking forward to see #76303 be publicly disclosed!\n\u003e\nWe can import reports for you, we link the reporter to a researcher by email. They will receive reputation and be listed on your program's HOF. I'm curious why you don't motivate researchers to report issues directly on HackerOne? We have some nice tools that help you identify signal and we have even more tools planned to help you respond to reports even faster!\n\u003e\nAbout recognizing researchers in your program. What we do in our own program: we add the researcher who submitted the duplicate report to the original report. You can simply do this by closing the report as a duplicate an tick the `Add _x_ to the original report` checkbox). The duplicate report gets `+2` instead of `+7` reputation, this can be fixed easily by reopening the duplicate and closing it as a resolved bug. If your program receives a lot of reports where multiple researchers are working on the same report, we could look into a more elegant solution. But so far we don't see much reports with true collaboration between researchers.\n\u003e\nHopefully this helps! If you have any further questions, please let us know.\n\nMy reply:\n\n\u003eThanks for the helpful reply, Willian.\n\u003e\n\u003e\u003e I'm curious why you don't motivate researchers to report issues directly on HackerOne?\n\u003e\n[We do](https://hackerone.com/gratipay)! The issue in question (#76303) is one of a handful that we manually migrated over from our old legacy security queue just last week. I guess it would've been better for us to run that through you. :-( Are you able to manually update the reporters for us if I point out the relevant tickets to you?\n\u003e\nGood to know about the +2 effect of duplicates on reputation.
