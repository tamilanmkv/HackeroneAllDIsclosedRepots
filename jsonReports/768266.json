On analysing the SSL certificate, I reported here to the DoD.\n\n**Description:**\nOn checking the SSL certificate, the details show:\n\n```\nIssued to and Issued By records:\n\nCN: █████\nOrganization(O): █████████\nOrganizational Unit (OU): ███\n```\nHere, this instance is already authenticated and this does not require a password to login. The major impact of this vulnerability is, an attacker can exploit and gain access to critical internals of the server as `/script` is enabled.\n\nThrough `/script`, an attacker can run remote commands on the server through the Java programming language.\n\n## Impact\n\nUnauthenticated instances of Jenkins with `/script` enabled can lead to an attacker running remote command on the instance.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Go to https://███/script/\n  1.1 Check the SSL certificate for proof.\n\n2. In the textbox that comes up, enter the following code:\n\n```bash\n\"ls /\".execute().text\n```\n\n3. The Response is\n\n```\nResult: bin\nboot\ndev\netc\nhome\nlib\nlib64\nmedia\nmnt\nopt\nproc\nroot\nrun\nsbin\nsrv\nsys\ntmp\nusr\nvar\n```\n\nAfter verifying this issue, I looked up `██████████` and `█████`. That's how I confirmed that this instance was of critical importance.\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\n\nJenkins\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions:\n\nMitigation for this, as per my understanding would be to add a 2FA authentication if this instance is in use. If this instance is not in use, please shut down the instance.\n\nP.S: I've also attached a PoC video of the same for clarity and reference. I am reporting this issue to the US DOD as ██████████ would be more logical to be associated with the DOD. If this bug is not acknowledged here, please forward this report to the authority that handles the US ███████.\n\n## Impact\n\nOn a Jenkins instance with `/script` enabled, an attacker can remote commands on the server and this can later lead to critical information leakage, lateral movement and other catastrophic events as the instance can be manipulated by the skills of the attacker.\n\nSuch instances should be closed when not in use and authentication mechanisms should be properly enforced.","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":112,"voters":["agent-r5","sectex","r4d1kal","sw33tlie","hackandpwn","checkm50","a_d_a_m","mashoud1122","pirateducky","spam404","and 102 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6690713,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
