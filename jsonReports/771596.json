We did a code review and determined the issue is in a legacy url.hostname() API. Not sure if it's a known issue or not, I wasn't able to find any report related to `url.hostname()`.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n```\npoc_url = \"http://test1.com\\n\\rtest2.com\"\n\nconst url = require('url');\nconsole.log(\"Vulnerable: \", url.parse(poc_url).hostname)\n\nconsole.log(\"\\n\")\n\nconst myURL = new URL(poc_url);\nconsole.log(\"Not Vulnerable: \", myURL.hostname)\n```\n\nNot exactly sure where is the problem, but probably in here:\n`https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/url.js#L298-L340`\n\n## Impact:\n\nEven if it's legacy code, there still might be a lot of projects and codebases relying on it. As mentioned in the description, I was able to bypass a whitelist function during the recent penetration test and exploit a medium/high vulnerability thanks to it.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\nPoc:\n```\npoc_url = \"http://test1.com\\n\\rtest2.com\"\n\nconst url = require('url');\nconsole.log(\"Vulnerable: \", url.parse(poc_url).hostname)\n\nconsole.log(\"\\n\")\n\nconst myURL = new URL(poc_url);\nconsole.log(\"Not Vulnerable: \", myURL.hostname)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nVulnerable:  test1.com\n\nNot Vulnerable:  test1.comtest2.com\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nWhitelist function can use url.parse(\"https://example.com\").hostname to check for allowed hostnames. It can be easily bypassed using CRLF injection and it can lead to whitelist bypass and compromise of the website.","weakness":{"id":69,"name":"CRLF Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":2,"voters":["1337310","mehrshad232"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":666,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6735960,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Security issues with url.parse are known and are not likely to be fixed given that the legacy parser and api is on the deprecation path.
