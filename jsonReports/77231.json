An example of a breaking update would be the update from version 1.x to version 2.x, or version 2.x to version 3.x. When a breaking update happens, the plugin runs a special compatibility check on each of the modules. During the check for a module, this hash is generated and saved to the database. The compatibility check only takes a few moments, and after it is finished the hash is deleted from the database.\n\nSo, in order for an attacker to exploit the weak hashing algorithm, he would need to guess the exact time that the compatibility check for a module was being performed. He would then have only a few seconds to perform the exploit. If he did guess the time a breaking update was being performed, he would only be able to achieve a minor information disclosure.\n\nBecause breaking updates are rare occurrences, and only last a few seconds, I made a deliberate choice to use a weak hashing algorithm. I thought that it would be an accepted risk. And I admit that using PHP's `md5()` function was just an easy thing to do. However, now I do think that maybe it would be better to use a stronger hashing algorithm. At least it would be a better example to new coders who do not know that md5 is unsafe.\n\n##\\src\\admin\\includes\\class-wordpoints-modules-list-table.php line 541\n\nI think that the value is hashed here just to generate a unique `id` attribute for the checkbox element. I will explore this further. Maybe hashing is not needed here at all.\n\n##\\src\\components\\points\\includes\\class-wordpoints-points-logs-query.php line 705\n\nI think this is the most serious case. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.\n\nHere the hash is being used as a key for the cache. The attacker can manipulate the hash value if user-supplied data is incorporated into the query to be cached. This could allow an attacker to expose the results for a different query by causing a hash collision.\n\nThe query results which could be exposed to the attacker would not be very sensitive. But the vulnerability should still be fixed.\n\n## Summary\n\nI will study each of these cases more. I will remove the use of the md5 hashing algorithm in each case, and replace it with a stronger algorithm. I will keep you updated.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-07-21T13:44:33.668Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T13:44:33.668Z","actor":{"username":"jdgrimes","cleared":false,"url":"/jdgrimes","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/009/109/d46d46e7dd9a78c3bd46390279cd42d1c1e76124_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpoints","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":519030,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-07-21T13:46:08.660Z","updated_at":"2015-07-21T13:46:08.660Z","actor":{"url":"/wordpoints","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/361/a0559c0ee47289ddff142d66426b278b32961dc9_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"WordPoints"}},"bounty_amount":"25.0","bounty_currency":"usd","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpoints","collaborator":{"username":"ru94mb","url":"/ru94mb"},"actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":519069,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@jdgrimes Thank you for detailed analysis of the issues.
