Password reset links do actually expire, but not on a password change or email change, like you suggest to implement. They expire when they are used, but more importantly, there's a time aspect involved. This time aspect really limits the time window in which you could potentially mount such an attack. \n\nSorry, but we don't consider this a realistic scenario.
