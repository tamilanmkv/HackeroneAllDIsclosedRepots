Through a series of micro-payments, a malicious program manager is able to pay a full amount to the hacker while evading the 20% H1 commission fee. \n\n**Description:**\nH1 has a system for awarding and paying hackers a monetary amount for a report. On each payment, HackerOne charges a 20% commission fee. As an example, if a program awards the hacker with 100$, HackerOne charges 20$. The total amount the program will have to pay is 100$ + 20$ = 120$.\n\nWhile testing, we noticed that we can enter a `float` value when issuing a reward, for example - 0.0004 . This resulted in an error and the request did not go through. Next, we noticed that the `bounty_award` and `bounty_fee` fields have a `float` type as well. During testing, we noticed that it has a limit of two numbers after the dot - `0.00`.\nFinally, we observed that the system has rounding values.\n\nThe `bounty_fee` is calculated as such:\n`bounty_fee` = `bounty_award/100*20`\n\n## Testing done:\n`bounty_award` = 1$ , `bounty_fee` = 0.2$\n`bounty_award` = 0.1$ , `bounty_fee` = 0.02$\n`bounty_award` = 0.01$ , `bounty_fee` = 0.002$ , but `bounty_fee` rounds two only two decimals. After rounding, the system will result in value - `bounty_fee`=`0.00`$\n\n### Optimal values\n`bounty_award` = 0.02$ , `bounty_fee` = 0.004$ - system rounding and will `bounty_fee` = 0.00$\n`bounty_award` = 0.03$,  `bounty_fee` = 0.006$ - system rounding and will `bounty_fee` = 0.01$ - not ideal\n\nIf the value is between 0.000 - 0.004, system rounding and will be `0.00` - good.\nIf the value is between 0.005 - 0.009, system rounding and will be `0.01` - bad.\n\nThis lead us to conclude that the optimal value to set a reward is 0.02$.\n\nThus, by sending multiple set award requests with a value of 0.01$ or 0.02$, we will effectively avoid the 20% commission fee.\n\nIn the report we show the result of working with the value 0.01$\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1) Select a report that should be rewarded\n2) In our testing we used report #808343\n3) Set award amount - 0.01$\n4) Intercept the request\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/bulk\n```\nPOST\nX-CSRF-Token: you_token_:)\n\nmessage=\u0026substate=bounty-award\u0026bounty_amount=0.01\u0026reference=\u0026add_reporter_to_original=false\u0026reply_action=set-bounty\u0026mark_ineligible_for_bounty=false\u0026reports_count=1\u0026report_ids%5B%5D=808343\u0026bounty_currency=USD\n```\n\n5) Repeat this request multiple times - this can do using an intruder style attack with null payloads, e.g. 100 requests.\n6) Check the billing dashboard under https://hackerone.com/hackerone_h1p_bbp3/billing.json?month=3\u0026year=2020\n\n```\n`{\"activity_date\":\"2020-03-02T10:56:29.265Z\",\"activity_description\":\"Bounty for report #808343\",\"report_id\":808343,\"team_handle\":\"hackerone_h1p_bbp3\",\"report_url\":\"https://hackerone.com/reports/808343\",\"reporter\":\"ggttss1\",\"bounty_award\":0.01,\"bounty_fee\":0.0,\"debit_or_credit_amount\":-0.01,\"paid_to_hacker_date\":null}`\n```\n\nE.g:\n\"bounty_award\":0.01,\"bounty_fee\":0.0,\"debit_or_credit_amount\":-0.01`\n\nThe 20% fee was not paid.\n\n9) After all the testing and using the best values we have:\n`https://hackerone.com/hackerone_h1p_bbp3/billing.json?month=3\u0026year=2020`\n\n###{\"balance\":99.88,\"fee_percentage\":20.0,\"team_active\":true,\"billing_2_0\":true,\"has_credit_card\":false,\"billing_start_date\":\"2020-02-11T00:01:22.214+00:00\",\"total_bounty_award\":1.28,\"total_fees\":0.05,\"invoice_total\":1.33,\"ending_balance\":98.55\n\nRewarded: 1.28$\nFee: 0.05$ \nInvoice total: 1.33$\n\nWhere in reality, it should have been:\nRewarded: 1.28$\nFee: (1.28/(100*20))  ~ 0.26$\nInvoice total: 1.33$\n\nWeâ€™ve effectively saved 0.21$. Obviously, this will have a big impact long term, especially when dealing with substantial amounts.\n\nThanks , @haxta4ok00 !\n\n## Impact\n\nBypassing the 20% commission charged by HackerOne, resulting in substantial financial loss for the platform.","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic
