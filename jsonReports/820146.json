They informed me that eval-stdin.php can be exploited for remote code execution when PHPUnit is publicly available on the web server and FastCGI is used to integrate PHP with that web server.\n```\n\nI was not able to exploit this using different FastCGI configurations. However, again according to phpcc:\n\n```\nAn HTTP post payload can only be accessed via the php://stdin stream if PHP is used by the web server via CGI or FastCGI. I was not sure if php://stdin really behaves like this, so I reached out to PHP core developers. Joe Watkins and Christoph M. Becker were able to confirm that php://stdin behaves like this and that its implementation is based on the specifications for CGI and FastCGI, which mandate access to the request payload via the standard input stream.\n```\n\nIf the Nextcloud is configured so that the url still contains `index.php` I was able to access the `eval-stdin.php` file without authentication.\nNote that the following apps also include the phpunit package:\n - https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/carnet\n - https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/discoursesso\n - https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/extract\n\n## Impact\n\nAccording to the PHP core developers and PrestaShop the `eval-stdin.php` makes it possible to perform RCE.\nMy research shows that in at least certain circumstances (i.e., index.php is not rewritten) the `eval-stdin.php` file is accessible.","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-07-25T12:15:29.039Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-38286985.66949928,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":9,"voters":["a_d_a_m","brahim_boufakri01","ali","sa1tama0","cryptographer","rupeshsahay","theklash77","love07oj","helius"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":7329338,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us!\n\nOur security team will take a look at this issue as soon as possible.
