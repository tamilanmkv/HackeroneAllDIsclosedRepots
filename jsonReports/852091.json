Install Steam on a fresh PC and login an account. After that, go to `Device Manager -\u003e Sound, video and game controllers`, check if `Steam Streaming Microphone` and `Steam Streaming Speakers` exist (those 2 drivers will be installed at the first time streaming via ==Remote Play==, so at this point those 2 drivers do not exist).\n1. Install [SteamLink](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.steamlink\u0026hl=vi) on an android device which is within the same LAN with the PC and login.\n1. Replace files in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\drivers\\Windows10\\x64` with my files in {F792263}, make sure that Steam is running at this point, otherwise Steam will replace my files with the original ones.\n1. Connect to PC from SteamLink.\n1. After successful authorization, `Steam Streaming Microphone` (40Kb) and my ==fake== `Steam Streaming Speakers` (8Kb) will be installed. You can check in `Device Manager -\u003e Sound, video and game controllers`\n\n{F793247}\n\n* The core of this vulnerability is SteamServices install driver without checking driver files' integrity (Steam.exe checked and replaced with original ones at the beginning of the session), while the driver's files can be written by normal users.
