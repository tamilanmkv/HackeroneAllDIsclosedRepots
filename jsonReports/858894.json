On the internal user profiles for hackers, a small overview is shown that lists the skills the user tagged their penetration tester profile with. Although the skills are currently managed by HackerOne and a user can only pick skills from a list, an XSS payload can be injected in the skill name to execute JavaScript in the backend system. In case we would allow penetration testers to enter their own skills in a free-form text format, it could lead to a stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability that is exploited by people outside of HackerOne.\n\n# Proof of concept\nTo reproduce, make sure your local environment is set up correctly by running the following code:\n\n```ruby\nSkill.create! name: '\u003cscript\u003ealert(/XSS/);\u003c/script\u003e'\nUser.find_by!(username: 'hacker').update! h1_pentester: true\n```\n\nNext, authenticate as the `hacker` user and enable the `pentester-profile` feature. Go to http://localhost:8080/settings/pentests and create a penetration tester profile with the skill that was created earlier. When the profile is created successfully, sign in to the Support Backend at http://localhost:8080/support and navigate to http://localhost:8080/support/users/hacker. The XSS payload injected in the skill name will be executed.\n\n████\n\n# Root cause\nThe following code leads to two Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities:\n\n**lib/support/app/controllers/support/tables/columns/pentester_profile_skills.rb**\n```ruby\ndef render(record)\n  return unless record.pentester_profile.present?\n\n  skill_names = record.pentester_profile.skills.map(\u0026:name)\n  content = \"\u003cspan\n    data-toggle='tooltip'\n    data-placement='top'\n    style='cursor: pointer; font-weight: bold'\n    title='#{skill_names.join(\"\\n\")}'\u003e\n      #{skill_names.join(', ')}\n    \u003c/span\u003e\"\n  content.html_safe\nend\n```\n\nDue to the lack of sanitization of the skill name, an attacker can append additional HTML attributes and elements, including elements and attributes that execute JavaScript. The code `title='#{skill_names.join(\"\\n\")}'\u003e` can be exploited using skill name `'onclick='alert(/XSS/);`. The code `#{skill_names.join(', ')}` can be exploited using `\u003cscript\u003ealert(/XSS/);\u003c/script\u003e`.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could use this in the future to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the Support Backend. Please note that in the production environment, inline execution of JavaScript is **not** allowed, significantly reducing the exploitability of these vulnerabilities.","weakness":{"id":62,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-06-03T20:56:49.447Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-42748713.75648194,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":68,"voters":["pyrrhon","newbipath12","base_64","sameerphad72","prophet","ali","zeroxyele","0xd0m7","ronr","holyfield","and 58 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":5.9,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"high","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":7788050,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-04-24T21:59:14.536Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T21:59:14.536Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7788052,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::NotEligibleForBounty","message":"This report is ineligible for a bounty because it was found by a HackerOne employee.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-04-24T21:59:43.883Z","updated_at":"2020-04-24T21:59:43.883Z","actor":{"url":"/security","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/013/fa942b9b1cbf4faf37482bf68458e1195aab9c02_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"HackerOne"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7892037,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"All instances where user input was used in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS have been audited and fixed where needed.
