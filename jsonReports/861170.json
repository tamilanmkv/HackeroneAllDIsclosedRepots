The library we choose to use is (SQLAlchemy-Paginator)[https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy-Paginator/] and we leveraged their examples to generate the pagination footer (Example1 in their documentation):\n```python\n{%- for page in pagination.paginator %}\n  {% if pagination.number == page.number %}\n  \u003cli class=\"page-item active\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"page-link\" href=\"{{ url_for(endpoint, p=page.number) }}\"\u003e\n      {{ page.number }} \u003cspan class=\"sr-only\"\u003e(current)\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  {% else %}\n  \u003cli class=\"page-item\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"page-link\" href=\"{{ url_for(endpoint, p=page.number) }}\"\u003e\n      {{ page.number }}\n    \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  {% endif %}\n{%- endfor %}\n```\nAt first glance, it looks quite harmless. However, when we dug into the implementation, we noticed the issue:\n```python\nclass Paginator\n  def __iter__(self):\n    self.__iter_page = 1\n    return self\n    \n  def next(self):\n    page = self.page(self.__iter_page)\n    self.__iter_page += 1\n    return page\n\n  def page(self, page_number):\n    page_number = self.validate_page_number(page_number)\n    offset = (page_number - 1) * self.per_page_limit\n    return Page(self.query_set.offset(offset).limit(self.per_page_limit).all(), # this is loading all of the results\n        page_number, self)\n```\nThe iterate is creating page objects and eagerly loading the all results into memory. \n\nThe fix we put in place was to replace the loop with just a range of page numbers:\n\n```python\n{%- for page_number in range(1, pagination.paginator.total_pages): %}\n  {% if pagination.number == page_number %}\n  \u003cli class=\"page-item active\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"page-link\" href=\"{{ url_for(endpoint, p=page_number) }}\"\u003e\n      {{ page_number }} \u003cspan class=\"sr-only\"\u003e(current)\u003c/span\u003e\n    \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  {% else %}\n  \u003cli class=\"page-item\"\u003e\n    \u003ca class=\"page-link\" href=\"{{ url_for(endpoint, p=page_number) }}\"\u003e\n      {{ page_number }}\n    \u003c/a\u003e\n  \u003c/li\u003e\n  {% endif %}\n{%- endfor %}\n```\n\n\u003e I am really trying hard to improve my DoS testing methodologies and I believe I followed the best practices of testing for DoS, while finding and reporting this issue\n\nThank you for improving your techniques, our team appreciates that you are changing your behavior, it helps a lot!
