I would have managed to sign up and buy the product too if you had asked me to. If its a matter of just signing-up and buying product then sir i'd say it is not justifiable for severity. Its a subdomain takeover and I'd have hosted and shown whatever i wanted to representing hackerone, subdomain takeover is same for all,  I don't know how are you reviewing this but unfortunately i'd request a little more justification because I am not satisfied. I have seen many takeover where info.hacker.one which was not even near to hackerone was handled with good severity and still mine is a main domain subdomain. Looking for your review kindly. An attacker could've used someone's or theirs uberflip account if they had one to takeover. if not then creating one was not a big issue. Subdomain takeover is different, 95% of companies who strictly doesn't allow *.domain.com testing, only specific domain testing, accepts subdomain takeovers with a good severity and handle them with priority.

Hacker.one was no where in scope back then if seen with fact but it was still treated nicely? do we or hackerone customers go to hacker.one to submit vulnerabilities or view reports? i don't go there. I go to hackerone.com but why? due to the trust, and if attacker has defaced hackerone.com subdomain, victim would surely go there due to hackerone.com subdomain and trust! It can be used for phishing, data entry, surveys, xss and many more things I believe defacing means that right? you chose `High` option in severity for `Privilege Escalation` i mentioned before it should be `low` if not `none` because uberflip is a public product, but you chose it `high` so this vulnerability doesn't go above `low` severity because changing it to `low` would make this vulnerability `medium` severe. I am quite surprised I have to explain the impact of that vulnerability which is quite straight forward and not complex. The main thing is a domain, which is hackerone.com domain, which people trusts and due to hackerone.com subdomain we could have done much more actions. People wont trust a phishing page with pleaselogin.tk domain but would trust resources.hackerone.com.\n\nAt first you said it would serve as www.hackerone.com only after taking over subdomain that's why it is being treated low, I shown the way of defacing it, then still its a low severe vulnerability. Totally fine. As i couldn't takeover myself and see what could happen. Here are some points i am mentioning below what could be achieved after defacing and how it'd hurt confidentially.\n\nI have a recommendation, why don't you put any type of survey in resources.hackerone.com and mention that winner would get $500 as a reward, and once done just tell me, I'd send that link to victims and let's see if they'd respond or not, I think that'd affect confidentiality of hackerone customers and researchers, and also think that if that survey was served in other domain which is not known and random to people,  would people still fill that survey for that website then? and now you'd say this is social engineering i believe, well what are subdomain takeovers then?  I am hoping that i'd just get more questions so the severity don't get increased, This was a `high` severity issue if was treated fairly, but unfortunately, it was never. I can't argue more, you can disclose the report after review and don't forget to remove the attachments I mentioned previously before disclosure if possible, thanks.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-05-15T17:22:45.329Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T17:36:52.237Z","actor":{"username":"amans","cleared":false,"url":"/amans","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/260/086/7e52a47867e42c3a048e38f03c0e95c05b6d05a4_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8014122,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-05-15T17:52:07.470Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T17:52:07.470Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Low (3.4)","new_severity":"Low (3.6)","old_severity_id":717936,"new_severity_id":723030},"actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8014262,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @amans - our threat model looks very different from 3 years ago.

Our marketing sites have their Environmental Score set to `C:M,I:L,A:L`, which brings down the severity of a medium to a low.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-05-15T17:57:47.425Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T17:57:47.425Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8014320,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@jobert - I am unsure sir, how your CVSS calculator works and how mine works.\n\n{F829805}","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-05-15T17:59:03.306Z","updated_at":"2020-05-15T17:59:03.306Z","actor":{"username":"amans","cleared":false,"url":"/amans","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/260/086/7e52a47867e42c3a048e38f03c0e95c05b6d05a4_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"attachments":[{"id":829805,"filename":"Hackerone_CVSS.jpg","type":"image/jpeg","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v7DT7vRTQkwpmN3pgjZuE3o6?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Hackerone_CVSS.jpg%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Hackerone_CVSS.jpg\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQYC7ZV3WT%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T153544Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIDrMLp4%2BWn0RnMngqqBOAomCU8GWEnyzbfeWXMTkRqdkAiEAmbCt%2FtYvzimCcqsBY5T%2BAP6C1koJvsZIEr7pm24tsEAqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDHO5iuzPFsJ4aK7KmSrXA43fG9ZExUYtmldfJFAHkWRlov9q%2FHMMPiqI7JWoul8iB2lnCe0Z8UD9oM5cfjZfhntNLx94myZGJfeT24YbqZ%2BCsOqn%2BPXRlK7VWqoq1AV8zdBtboSY1qGlF1yW0h8xQvR1G807ShHTgDzCxdIUl0y2PUXdt%2BRNIlHckLFzjBfbJBmGFikh%2B68wwr3qhH%2BRekBJT8dRJqkMmVmJIoL4rn3y%2FCM010RJxL86Xuoat%2BrN046smSjkfceh4bPaJkOADf33dP%2FBliSDcBjoMG74ZFHPAmgnqoN439xdfqhUpIPqNFrcRU1WpQhc12VYut5tMZcbmJchXopaXhvm%2B4orW3DihHvyn7HD%2BiT1cpN9baXaycQzr%2B68J9MyG01Zce8VNQxPm5eRp7v9dtdfEQ9sF3yuOsWzUwY%2BTHCD7SIcVsQFrS5Z2L5Ux3CncTXxkqQVlNCyHTcJODpncVKfD7b6uHxsAmVawhDDZJgLpATJPpVIaGa0em09aEDUcT%2FuazJtx1N1gOr8ZYZSsD6LmJlT7xfEsyzeZ%2BC%2FQQSJKyYRebEtRjLR%2BsYz4MKD2jlXjj62sVdjHko29e6c4eso%2Fx8%2Bjrkj%2BYuyD88VzMWxszti4qHccB7%2Fr3%2BsDzDViZGLBjqlAc5vcHGjagoOTjMDz6VCxHAyKKMhBY%2F4ksl1iKt3Mkg6KIb8dD7WB3B5bRwalHdLpA6q%2F0HyHwVC3k8nRLkVacoHC%2BTnF8IsDYgQMa3VWvq9UB5BqCGPwIE9Smv%2FlQf6eGWyrcOO%2Brsi6UGSaKxoz3eFt2y8zMnz71sdDkZshTNAZoB15M%2BSMQApjyeteOn3dhbojlsBvMBhOE%2FWaBGY2zXmhSJaSA%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=b54f3ae15435c93328a739038f3af966977436bc8b16d2790cf1c6dfde54b691"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8014350,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@amans Can you select www.hackerone.com as asset?
