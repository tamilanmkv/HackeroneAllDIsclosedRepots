This vulnerability requires you to be an authenticated user.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nStep 1. Visit /wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=forum\nStep 2. Click on **Add New**\nStep 3. Write any title, and in content, write your XSS payload through the \"Text\" editor, rather than the \"Visual\" one, and publish the content.\nStep 4. Now, visit /wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=forum, and you will be able to see the payload getting executed.\n\n## Recommendations\nMaking use of proper functions in PHP or WordPress core in the bbPress source code regarding the filtering or sanitization of user input is a recommended way to fix this vulnerability.\n\n## Impact\n\nBy taking an advantage of this vulnerability, an owner of a WordPress-based website would be able to execute their malicious JavaScript codes in context to the WordPress dashboard, which could result in bad issues to other users.","bounty_amount":"225.0","formatted_bounty":"$225","weakness":{"id":62,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) -
