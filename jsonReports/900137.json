This information that the attacker has access to includes usernames, CAC User ID's, e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, first/middle/last name, and other information about a vast majority of U.S. military personnel. The portal also clearly indicates \"For Official Use Only - Privacy Sensitive\". Additionally, an attacker conveniently has access to export this data as a pdf, csv, or xls file, which makes data exfiltration easy. Note that this vulnerability appears to be very similar to report #808338. Please see the attached PoC videos (note that there are 2 videos because after I made the first video I realized I could scroll across and see the user's CAC User ID information, which seems very important in terms of logging into U.S. military systems). I believe this is a critical vulnerability based on the CVSS scale.\n\n## Impact\nAn adversary can sign up for an account on https://█████████/pages/login.aspx to gather a vast amount of PII related to a large portion of U.S. military personnel. This can be used for many purposes and should not be accessible by a regular user.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Go to https://██████████/pages/login.aspx\n2. Select 'Request New Account' and log into your account\n3. Once logged in go to Administration -\u003e User -\u003e Users\n4. Observe all the information about different users on the platform\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\nhttps://██████/pages/login.aspx\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nLimit this function to administrators only, as regular users should not be able to access this type of data (especially when any user can sign up from the open internet.\n\n##References\nPlease see the attached PoC videos.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can sign up for an account on https://█████████/pages/login.aspx to gather a vast amount of PII related to a large portion of U.S. military personnel.
