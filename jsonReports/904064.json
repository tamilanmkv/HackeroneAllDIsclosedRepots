When sharing their dashboard, the message is not fully sanitized for HTML characters before sending to the recipient. This allows the attacker to craft a believable spearphishing e-mail coming from an e-mail address owned by the ███████.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Create an account or sign into ██████.\n2. Browse to ███████/█████\n3. Create a dashboard by clicking the dropdown menu and selecting `New Dashboard`.\n████\n4. Once you create the dashboard, go back to ███/██████ and select the dashboard you created.\n5. You should see a `share` icon in the top right. Click this and click `Add groups and users`.\n███\n6. If you start typing in the `To:` field, a list of names should populate. Select the name of an account you own.\n█████████\n7. Check the `Send an email invitation box`. Populate the `Message` field with your spearphishing attempt (this can contain various HTML elements) and click `Share`.\n██████\n8. The victim will receive an e-mail from ██████████ with the injected HTML. As you can see below, the `\u003cimg\u003e` tag did not work correctly but the other formatting seemed to work fine. This allows the adversary to get very creative..\n██████████\n*Note: the message above says \"...shared with you by unagi unagi.\", however an attacker could simply sign up with a first/last name of \"████████\" or something similar to make this more believable.*\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nSanitize all HTML tags prior to sending the e-mail to the recipient.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn adversary could conduct a spearphishing campaign from an ██████ mail server - the scale of effects would be dependent on the creativity of the attacker and the gullibility of the victim.","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":4,"voters":["un4gi","ali","nidens","khizer47"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8358769,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
