Then when a user who created this tour clicks analytic and clicks to export responses as csv, he will see TRUE instead of  =AND(1\u003e2) Meaning that cell is now active, and an attacker could make a response  using a malicious function to execute malware on a team member's pc. Since functions aren't escaped, the possibilities of using this can be limitless and can cause a severe impact. One example is having it execute malware on staff's computer as seen below, leveraging cmd to execute commands.\n\nCrude Poc for executing cmd\nuse -2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!D2 and could execute malicious commands through CMD. \nD2 is the cell it's located in.\n\n\nThis can be adapted to other spread sheet views like Libre as well\nAlthough excel has a feature to block this by tell a user that it wants to execute an external script, the team member would believe it's a trusted file coming from a trusted website and you will have a very high chance of this being executed.
