And if you change this ID to victim's content ID, you will see victim's content at `My Content` page. But you can't see responses or edit it. You can only change status etc if you have a free account.\n\nSo I found another way to takeover victim's content completely via team account.\nIn team accounts, you have another move option that named `Move to another user`. Basically, you can move your contents to users (in your team) .\nAnd if you follow same steps again but with `Move to another user` option, you can see victim's content in your team user's account.\n\n**Please note, content IDs are sequential, so attacker can takeover any content.**\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n- **With Free account (limited access to victim's content)**\n  1. Go to https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard\n  1. Click to checkbox on your any content and turn on Intercept at Burp Suite\n  1. Click to `Move to \u003e My Content`\n  1. And change `actionable[]` parameter's value with victim's content ID.\n  1. Go to `My Content`.\n- **With Team account (full access to victim's content)**\n  1. Add your second email on https://app.crowdsignal.com/users/list-users.php and confirm it\n  2. Go to https://app.crowdsignal.com/dashboard\n  3. Click to checkbox on your any content and turn on Intercept at Burp Suite\n  4. Click to `Move to \u003e Move to another user`\n  5. Select your second account, click `Move`\n  6. Change `actionable[]` parameter's value with victim's content ID.\n  7. Go to your second account and check dashboard\n\n## PoC video for full access to victim's content:\n{F893412}\n\n## Impact\n\nIDOR leads to takeover victim's content\n\nThanks,\nBugra","bounty_amount":"550.0","formatted_bounty":"$550","weakness":{"id":55,"name":"Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":893407,"file_name":"request.PNG","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/rpVEDhrUKpchG3RULQzrQV6c?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22request.PNG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27request.PNG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQTQR22CE2%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T154147Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHylhpFJOF4pRe7XlaDX6z3BLEup%2BswnNkaACr%2Fwjwr8AiASjuyeD0TYwrZA5sOldf5eC6UQrO8hSHC9jNR%2BVNumhyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMfK%2BofD1wJOHYcOUJKtcDnC3f8Y3jglGs7z8YlxF9bdYkYlsSrPxEkx9hDqtH%2BQ3u1daZrwyM6F3WHlk0a%2BWNezGk%2FnRxFWuvgXlXXAEBaCUWEe1UXv97gs6KKr%2F4fZ92%2FH3VXeVMioYLi220Z8qDdmiwSK2Z%2FPfK0nlRhO3v9Ee3r3C7BMq5B4DRnfxp0cJyzU%2FHbMNzQNjyO%2BlGzreHCzcyKBe%2FoFAr2W6xbLokCINrIUxMnvI9Mxs7SraD%2FF2sZw8Ln4uZ6aJweQoOPwsnYKkrRjb370Lt%2FREkrEj9pcgae0C9R5BTZegZaqNN6CzMkZfNHB7RmNrhJFg6j7%2BfPYLcWFNxzvJV9dbVJdocqrM5Jmi3hE47KOBrMSGuFrCha2vRk9P64hqfhM1GdDtMLFZZn5VqOJgdyVWZ8bTrZpmlBP%2FJ6YiHIaMTH8G%2FRndaRrVRAR8iOSqWok%2FikWajxMvcVA29H%2F5RznwCFPkLrSbv34tOiWcwVp50Yy3HjkGq4LnY67LMRRRIwThQ9vc%2BM3G9xlb7TwO6%2F3vE5U6azDCH6hDFQ3Xi8ZJVYrTOOWINnf%2BC3BIhvL8Uql%2FhI1vUmbQiAR01xN%2FdEQ9ReTSo0pfJ3SDSXhBXiwUW0IRKspJO189rJyI3MImNkYsGOqYBwdOGh60JXyl1FPj8jwEbnfg6var6H0hyaUwn%2B%2FnamMWODqDwoSJI6f0Q6RJHnQJo2gfc6OFgj1W2B%2FGcJDL4gMvwPBD8bBDDMSaZ3x1nqw%2FhzMwsaQP%2BTnUJEKAVQSe3o5Yvwzg%2FSvpNP%2By981FbIZs9aWoGNPHY48ZIUNdNLCWPS2PxNm9xHrAxEcqn8ib1XLvQQS%2FALl2CG36%2BewUP2tPIf%2BIPmw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=0fcf3c0147c3938edbbabe2356da03351f7e4d34ebd9b55be1a96dd5a805578d","file_size":35056,"type":"image/png"},{"id":893412,"file_name":"CrowdSignal-IDOR.mp4","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2q2duuWmURccWFyefcvf6uNw?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22CrowdSignal-IDOR.mp4%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27CrowdSignal-IDOR.mp4\u0026response-content-type=video%2Fmp4\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQTQR22CE2%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T154147Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHylhpFJOF4pRe7XlaDX6z3BLEup%2BswnNkaACr%2Fwjwr8AiASjuyeD0TYwrZA5sOldf5eC6UQrO8hSHC9jNR%2BVNumhyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMfK%2BofD1wJOHYcOUJKtcDnC3f8Y3jglGs7z8YlxF9bdYkYlsSrPxEkx9hDqtH%2BQ3u1daZrwyM6F3WHlk0a%2BWNezGk%2FnRxFWuvgXlXXAEBaCUWEe1UXv97gs6KKr%2F4fZ92%2FH3VXeVMioYLi220Z8qDdmiwSK2Z%2FPfK0nlRhO3v9Ee3r3C7BMq5B4DRnfxp0cJyzU%2FHbMNzQNjyO%2BlGzreHCzcyKBe%2FoFAr2W6xbLokCINrIUxMnvI9Mxs7SraD%2FF2sZw8Ln4uZ6aJweQoOPwsnYKkrRjb370Lt%2FREkrEj9pcgae0C9R5BTZegZaqNN6CzMkZfNHB7RmNrhJFg6j7%2BfPYLcWFNxzvJV9dbVJdocqrM5Jmi3hE47KOBrMSGuFrCha2vRk9P64hqfhM1GdDtMLFZZn5VqOJgdyVWZ8bTrZpmlBP%2FJ6YiHIaMTH8G%2FRndaRrVRAR8iOSqWok%2FikWajxMvcVA29H%2F5RznwCFPkLrSbv34tOiWcwVp50Yy3HjkGq4LnY67LMRRRIwThQ9vc%2BM3G9xlb7TwO6%2F3vE5U6azDCH6hDFQ3Xi8ZJVYrTOOWINnf%2BC3BIhvL8Uql%2FhI1vUmbQiAR01xN%2FdEQ9ReTSo0pfJ3SDSXhBXiwUW0IRKspJO189rJyI3MImNkYsGOqYBwdOGh60JXyl1FPj8jwEbnfg6var6H0hyaUwn%2B%2FnamMWODqDwoSJI6f0Q6RJHnQJo2gfc6OFgj1W2B%2FGcJDL4gMvwPBD8bBDDMSaZ3x1nqw%2FhzMwsaQP%2BTnUJEKAVQSe3o5Yvwzg%2FSvpNP%2By981FbIZs9aWoGNPHY48ZIUNdNLCWPS2PxNm9xHrAxEcqn8ib1XLvQQS%2FALl2CG36%2BewUP2tPIf%2BIPmw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=b8b0fc1d6a32db71ba5a84eb6af54e4aa86a103d201dbe0f514aa3537c277a9d","file_size":1586452,"type":"video/mp4"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-12-18T02:56:33.829Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-25706713.35518628,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":75,"voters":["pyrrhon","ltidi","xploiterr","th4nu_0x0","prophet","bibekshah","bombon","ali","b3hlull","zeroxyele","and 65 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8499101,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your submission.
