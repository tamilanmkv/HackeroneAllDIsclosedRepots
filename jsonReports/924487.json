This leads to full disclosure of all available docker containers, the possibility to upload docker container and manipulate and delete existing docker containers.\n\n**Description:**\nFrom https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/docker-registry-api-is-accessible-without-authentication/ :\nThe Docker Registry HTTP API is the protocol to facilitate the distribution of images to the docker engine. It interacts with instances of the docker registry, which is a service to manage information about docker images and enable their distribution.\n\nThis Docker Registry API is accessible without authentication. A properly secured registry should return 401 when the \"/v2/\" endpoint is hit without credentials. The response should include a WWW-Authenticate challenge, guiding how to authenticate, such as with basic auth or a token service.\n\n## Impact\nHigh. An attacker can view all available (deployed) docker containers and their containing information, patch the containers to transform the containers to malicious containers (backdoors, malfunction, authentication bypass, RCE, etc.) and upload new possibly malicious containers.  \n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n### Viewing and Downloading existing docker containers \n 1. We can examine the existing docker containers by visiting https://██████████/v2/_catalog. We can see that multiple \"private\" custom docker containers are available (refer to `docker_catalog.png`)\n 2. We can download any of these containers with the following command `docker pull █████/\u003ccontainer\u003e`. For example we can download the container `█████████` with `docker pull ███████/███` (refer to `shell_download_container.png`)\n 3. At this point we can start the container with `docker run --rm -it █████████/█████ sh` and investigate what is inside the container, to look for credentials and other useful information, etc. (refer to `shell_inside_container.png`)\n\n### Uploading containers\n 1. We can not only view all the information in the existing containers, but we are also able to upload containers.\n 2. As a proof of concept, I uploaded the default `hello-world` container\n\n```\ndocker pull hello-world   # Get the hello-world docker\ndocker tag hello-world:latest ██████/chron0x/hello-world   # Set destination\ndocker push █████████/chron0x/hello-world   # Push \n```\n\n 3. Carefully observing https://█████/v2/_catalog we can see that the container `chron0x/hello-world` is present (refer to `docker_catalog_chron0x.png`) . The uploaded container is succesfully uploaded and would now be executed server-side. \n\n### Manipulating existing dockers\nCombining the two points above it is also possible to manipulate existing docker containers, by \n 1. Downloading an existing container\n 2. Patching the container \n 3. Uploading the container again\n\nWith such manipulations backdoors can be planted, the server can be taken over completely, authentications can be bypassed, forced into malfunction etc.\nI did not manipulate any of the existing containers since I did not want to mess with the system. I can of course present a manipulation, like planting a file into one of the containers on request.  \n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\nDocker Registry v2\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nRestrict access to the Docker Registry API. Except for registries running on secure local networks, registries should always implement access restrictions.\n\nThe simplest way to achieve access restriction is through basic authentication (this is very similar to other web servers basic authentication mechanism).\n\nCheck all existing docker containers for manipulations, or set them up again from scratch, since they have been potentially been tampered with. \n\n## Resources:\n * https://www.acunetix.com/vulnerabilities/web/docker-registry-api-is-accessible-without-authentication/\n * https://www.notsosecure.com/anatomy-of-a-hack-docker-registry/\n\n## Impact\n\nHigh. An attacker can view all available (deployed) docker containers and their containing information, patch the containers to transform the containers to malicious containers (backdoors, malfunction, authentication bypass, RCE, DDOS etc.) and upload new possibly malicious containers.","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":12,"voters":["chron0x_","prophet","cranelab","dastan_9408","hacknchill","facettedbee","v13rsba","chopperbz","blackmagic21","kanyetgg","and 2 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8609142,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
