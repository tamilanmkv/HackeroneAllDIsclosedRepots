As you invite someone , this is how the body of invitation is being sent through email :-\n\n[link to researcher's profile] invited you to join the bug [Title Of The Bug]  for [Name of the program]\n\nSo being an owner of a program I control  [Title Of The Bug] and [Name of the program] . So I can create any program on h1 , report a bug to it , keeping the Title of that bug and name of my program as per my choice .\n\nThis is how a Verified program on h1 can spoof the body of the email leading to phishing attacks but i suppose h1 trusts all of the verified programs so this may not be a risk .\n\nFor the Unverified programs , as you invite an external user , the body of email also contains a warning which minimizes the risk of further phishing attacks BUT it's not necessary to invite someone ONLY through emails ....\nFor eg.\n1. Attacker creates a program , reports a bug to it choosing the title of bug and name of the program as in the attached screenshot .\n2.  He then sends a mail to himself thus getting an invitation id !\n3. He can then personally invite someone through that invitation .\n\nfor eg . visit : https://hackerone.com/invitations/7e28fd3adb7f7bf2c155c66e534a9f69\nalso see the attached screenshot","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":56458,"file_name":"content_spoofing.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/056/458/6de17089b4a249af7637b7ad8f476baa90fb6c9d/content_spoofing.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22content_spoofing.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27content_spoofing.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQSEHZZ6G7%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T154300Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCICgcJulSRaAJ%2FlV4SEWAQTyL4zo08LbSxF3YkMq%2FNlQPAiEAwYnoA1Ejs7bfAWoTffEddff%2B50LJlobfOVtd1RM%2FYnEqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDNRRuPIe4WOmezSvuirXA0I2fovKepc%2Br2vRekK4MdhNGmdM4Pc0OuzIHNmi1YNhdeljOfmMGUcQHlPqei9TxAGt4a%2Bwb9xKRrQFaS2o2gwxQkFXonxhS2p2%2FCJsWYUo5r66Rt8sQTiLMsAQcSzSjjF4bWzRQlm%2FsXkyqmfct1BfShpBMKnI%2BGx4M48yQfNnfgyRoZjVuWMHzcNqo6i%2B3imvvfu1gDhHkBQgvqL6AhnkVsXPRp6bS08enQ%2B4LeWijQjUmlhVfE3gDt1zfAq%2Fe%2FxOw17jAAuZH4zvbU5%2FFtGrJy%2BmroOTUxv%2FmxiaS8mF368AXRZQT%2FQ%2BK1TgapuP6OgN2v4j35edAg5veKR5WdWsY0QgOpQDSxzsTc2OCErw7fYWcmQYeYhOLVSghUfUtkDG76jJaJQMd36SmC4L2sb2NQ06wkAJfvd6Xh2dj7rFd%2BeVtQEdiI0FpNpkr5AYIz9emwENChfGQLyYkIfW5YUmUZn7%2BrBuWRxITz%2B3soyUxqmlqH%2B32ar8fmBp4Ie0VZd5xxkyHz5L%2BO4aTQveejpP0KxMm2%2Flqz8faN%2FLDBmpyKrFPcJn0sktEBiYdZCKd%2FJMvehZSGrjjy%2F75WSa1FwB%2FTzTTFRrGtLtYGGYby7RdTaug%2BPMKTC2jZGLBjqlAW%2FqLgyIU3l7q2BIHZ9aOYbvAcm7k5gKph8EjMf6tXptYEaiHmQx1q5jFWsRXPiWMZbi4fKKkFbfrJI1NS%2FDW3ba%2FI9tKqyLv9ZB%2FyHxyGg3CQqjMAh5HPdI6A9scOywAto0wTVOHwkl9Ay%2BNQ%2BadpR1vVj4UXnFx6R7Mt2xHMMc188gMtdSb8CXyaP6RpR3xaP3OWl7wd9lKp0P5L%2BRwYyHexzCFA%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=e22ea0e7b6edaa3915108aa037dcec2b55bc7e10e110e1366041c20ed0be4d45","file_size":34510,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-11-19T19:33:15.942Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-186005384.58544886,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":2,"voters":["japz","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":611552,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"The attack looks more neat when you visit that link and if you are not logged in already .","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-10-06T17:56:09.711Z","updated_at":"2015-10-06T17:56:09.711Z","actor":{"username":"rohan_x3","cleared":false,"url":"/rohan_x3","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/752/66dbfc1ccd87ef18eb098b16ec74d1139021fa92_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":612502,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Pretty clever, but not a huge security issue.
