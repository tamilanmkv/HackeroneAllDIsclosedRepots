So protection will be bypassed in this case, as it is only writable by the user.\n\nIssue was discovered after review of CVE-2020-8177 description. I was curious how the Content-Disposition feature and prevention of file overwrite worked.  While reviewing the code around that feature noted that the existence of the file is checked via being able to read the file.  So what happens if the file is not readable, but writable!?!\n\nWhy would a system have a file that is writable only, for sensitive information that must be collected by a particular user, but must not be viewable by that user.  Certain logs or audit trails or privacy related files or security related files, might have such restrictions.\n\nAdditionally, and in an extreme example, code as written is susceptible to Race Condition as the file existence check and file write are done with two distinct fopen() calls in the tool_create_output_file() in tool_cb_wrt.c file.  Data lose possible if parallel write operations performed on the same file via two curl processes, or even some other process (malicious or not) acting/interfering on the same file.\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n1. Create a new file (e.g. echo \"TEST\" \u003edata.txt)\n2. Check content of file to see that file contains \"TEST\".\n3. Change permissions of new file to remove read permission (e.g. chmod 222 data.txt)\n4. Download file from remote server that will have Content-Disposition with filename \"data.txt\"\n5. Check that file data.txt is still only writable! Permissions have not changed.\n6. Change permissions to add the read permission back (so we can see the content)\n7. View the content of data.txt file, it will be overwritten with server response.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n1. Log of reproduction attached. See curl_reproduction.log attached.\n2. Source for a simple Golang HTTP server with Content-Disposition header also attached.  See httpserver.go file attached.\n\n\n## Mitigation:\n\nOne way to fix the issue robustly (check for file existence and create file in one operation) would be to use the open() to create the file while using safe options (such as O_CREAT | O_WRONLY | O_EXCL), as is shown in one of the solutions in this stackoverflow posting (see posting by \"Dan Lenski\", for example):\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/230062/whats-the-best-way-to-check-if-a-file-exists-in-c\n\n## Impact\n\n- An existing local file could be overwritten, either maliciously or accidentally by curl\n- A malicious server would need to send Content-Disposition with filename provided at the same time, as the victim would have to use the -J -O option on the curl command line side, with a file that is non-readable, but writable.","weakness":{"id":135,"name":"Improper Handling of Insufficient Permissions or

Users belonging to the file(s)/directory group might have only write permission.  User(s) part of this write-only group could be tasked to do various file fetching from different end points.  A group with least privilege.  These files could be sensitive, and you don't want the group members to be able to see the content or any other users content, but they must be able to put the files in the same directory.  To be really least privilege you would not even give these group members read access to the download directory (rwx-wx---), so they can't even check the filenames that already exist there.\n\nBefore performing curl to download, umask would be set to create write-only files.  umask 447 or something like that.\n\nActions involving deleting, renaming, moving, copying, backing up the file(s) will be done with a different process running with more privileges (e.g. root).\n\nIf somehow the system is hacked, and a user in this particular write-only group is the one that is hacked.  Using least privilege that user could not see what has been previously collected.  They might be able to see future downloaded data that the user is responsible to fetch if they hang around long enough to set that up, but any old data is safe. They still will not be able to see other user's data.\n\nThe file names are generated on the server, but there is a small chance that there might be some non-unique name that could overwrite an existing file. It is more important to not overwrite an existing file, versus successful download of the new server provided file.\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nAs second use case...\n\nA malicious server attempting to overwrite a file that might have this particular type of permission (as in previous use case), a fact discovered through some other means or just blindly attempted without the knowledge.\n\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nAnd as a final use case...\n\nAn accidental overwrite of an important file.

On the other hand, someone using this type of file permission is doing something special (e.g. anonymous dropbox) or handling some important data/function (e.g. whistle blower site) or sensitive data (e.g. security logs, billing files, audit files, backups). Maybe not the most common cases of curl usage, but their existence might be kept quiet due to the sensitive nature.\n\nThe solution developers have decided to use curl to implement their project and trusting their data to the software quality.  They may be using the software for years and may have already suffered this data loss without even being aware as there is no obvious failure except that a file gets overwritten quietly. If they haven't implement any thorough audits/tests, double checking curls work, then they are living in bliss, until someone eventually realizes the data loss after some expensive investigation and then depending on the data type it might be discovered that millions/billions of dollars/euros/etc... of billing data was lost over time, or some data loss results in fines (or worse) as it is considers mishandling of data in some government/industry regulation that requires strict data retention.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_retention\n\n\nI would like to add that the TOCTOU issue is for what is being considered the more common case of readable files.  As the write-only files are already invisible to the existing code.  Two parallel curl process in a race condition, each connecting to a different end point, and downloading a file with exactly the same name, both would return success, but only one of the file would be stored.  One file will be lost.  What should have happen is that one file would be stored and the other should fail, leading to being reattempted using some other name (e.g. the server has a way to be told by the client to provide a different name); or at the very least the curl failure being logged to get someone to investigate what is going on.\n\n\nBoth these issues, need one fix. Why not make the code more robust and check for file existence in a more generic way (already clearly documented by SEI CERT)?  It does not appear to be too difficult (e.g. using \"x\" in fopen() mode if C11 support required, or open() with secure options+fdopen() ), and maybe might solve some other issue(s) I haven't thought of.\n\n\nDocumenting this situation and closing the case is an easy solution.

I agree a robust server should generate a really unique filename. Then again, maybe we don't control the server and we are stuck with the way it already works, from time to time having some duplicate file name or some other poor naming structure. If a duplicate name occurs for readable files, the curl client will clearly fail, and some action can be taken, but if this happens for write-only it would cause data loss as curl would just quietly overwrite.\n\nA solution could involve retrieval of log files from multiple hosts and the various servers on the hosts may not be aware they are duplicating file names in their responses.  Yes maybe the client side should be more robust and dedicate different directories for each host, but if they are not aware of the curl fault so may mistakenly throw everything into the same directory and letting the curl failure tell then about the duplicate name, which will not be triggered for a write-only solution.\n\n-----------------------\n\nOur server could be malicious or hacked; and the controlling party is aware of this particular vulnerability of write-only files in the curl client and crafts the filename to overwrite files that it knows or guesses might be present in the client and known to be write-only, in order to delete some previously downloaded data it wants to destroy.\n\nOr the malicious server could ALWAYS send the SAME filename in the Content-Disposition, where it knows the client has these write-only type files, resulting in only one file being stored, causing many/several files overwriting each other.  They might also do this in a selective manner to not be too obvious.   Maybe only causing overwrite of certain files they don't want to be saved.\n\nBoth above hacks could also be easy to MITM if using HTTP (without the TLS) as the packet data manipulation might only involve setting the filename in the header, and leaving the data alone.  Manipulating the data might be noticed as it could be encrypted/signed, but the headers are in clear text and unsigned.\n\n-----------------------\n\nIf a malicious server responds with the same file name to curl client side with a similar local readable file, then obviously this will cause failure and be noticed.  If somehow the TOCTOU race condition could be reliably triggered in the client (e.g. the client system is performing a heavy number of 'curl' calls) they might even be able to cause loss of readable files.

You wouldn't implement any secure system that way.\n\n(I've never even heard of \"SEI CERT\" so I can't comment on that.)\n\n(and regarding billions of clients, this bug is limited to the command line tool which is not typically used by the billions of libcurl users)","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-07-21T09:13:37.629Z","updated_at":"2020-07-21T09:13:37.629Z","actor":{"username":"bagder","cleared":false,"url":"/bagder","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/variants/y9xzl5ayi7du4kz3l6pa6sff2ha5/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22final-12-1000x1000.jpg%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27final-12-1000x1000.jpg\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ57JDOB6N%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T154304Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHcaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIEj%2FvPHmMbBPYj%2BEqI%2BytJ5vP%2BW1Gij3b1KCROLW2m2fAiAUI2BnkECXV9d7hwkeZDEOYP6soFW%2FVQ7MIgaTaOghmSqDBAjw%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMaJpXtlkzQ%2F0YHokTKtcDqr54hfj92oRcu2Uf5AYn5X1dcYZ2fUSGzbf8TlAKPi%2BieszVvrvHI%2FlmbHmgiT1EynvsarNndOfkF2FRqu00jKx0CkmuRzepTozsI%2FVM4zmVsulVco0%2FTcUTH7ncLq5w17UCDOGpnW6JGeAot2EMSfGI%2BXeXow9Po2gINOm1gQnayfBCxU0Glim8HMTLVSft15PsLBhoVz6MQjjs5LpN9XS8yUG%2FvTzXTgclJY%2F9kWPo7VUzvyGgDBwaQ1NS4mY%2FwZ0AT%2BbZ6JXbFSX9ET%2BsjMi2Xi4Iz%2BSZK9IqUkrM05KykgVZmm0Jj83i2n43f%2BohD1oputpWW5Uu1cAXNs%2F4CRB2hvvyPQb%2B2khSXC6sOQi3exb9EuT5FkfOJXRD2w2ObGvWHxM%2BDQNczFHMaUBsCSSNn2cKqA093ghnjQ0g83xgTV9SBPb0QjpItD1Tnt9%2Bri%2FBh8RNCTedm%2Bor7TU6AnBCa6N50D96ANJhWhGw8kKZQdvzW0b0yw%2FH0clJ9XBtHGp1ul88rpA7tUuIoM7z31gr%2FReHR4G0fbpI0Bw%2BzUst%2BenEZyU7QQChxDc0u9loqAHNkWSJ3vDfDAhU2gFvocid02DAX%2FlKRXns4oUAYN7obhQgZX31MK2XkYsGOqYBmhNgLXdsx%2F8OPaK%2FmcpHbqK%2FVdgD3s09C%2FMBcjoeNruPiR%2B0%2FIpdgtcxNhaPoR0zb6re%2ByXh4v3hr2D2Z0%2BZCE4KiobLnf4PqE9a5czy2i5ctMeGIPCspubSRwCRBRORrnkT6%2FEocUc5PNqombEgctkvB80CoCyMfXpFqtIL0ne7x%2B%2B6lVkpXfm14Eb3XaRg7qWG7XL4Ud5U62KMTzbzA3t%2FxnvzsA%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=fea7ec877fa0baaaed0d05d60f9c7fa985269bcf29af903ebc3d52b007f0fa65"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"curl","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8661815,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Having read through, and pondered over, the evidence posted I too lean towards classifying this as bug.
