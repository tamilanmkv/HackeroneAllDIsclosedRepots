Summary\n\nMemory corruption can be achieved by sending fragmented IPv6 packets to loopback interface due to poor and inconsistent use of `IP6_EXTHDR_CHECK`.\n\nThe macro `IP6_EXTHDR_CHECK` can free the mbuf if the packet is sent to loopback interface. This fact is not considered in `dest6_input()`, `frag6_input()` and more. For example in `dest6_input()`, the double pointer is not updated:\n```\nint\ndest6_input(struct mbuf **mp, int *offp, int proto)\n{\n\tstruct mbuf *m = *mp;\n\t...\n\tIP6_EXTHDR_CHECK(m, off, sizeof(*dstopts), return IPPROTO_DONE);\n\t...\n\t*offp = off;\n\treturn dstopts-\u003eip6d_nxt;\n}\n```\n\nHence, when parsing next headers, the mbuf can be free'd once again, leading to a double free which behaves like a use-after-free when we allocate mbuf's again.\n\nNormally, this path would not be triggerable, because sending to loopback interface requires SOCK_RAW root privileges. **However, for some reason on the PS4 SOCK_RAW sockets can be opened in Webkit process!**\n\nAttached is `poc.c` which must run with root privileges on a FreeBSD 9 machine. It demonstrates being able to escalate privileges to kernel.\nAttached is also `ps4.c` which is slightly adjusted to work on the PS4 (you'd need to add includes etc to be able to compile it with your official sdk, I compiled it with a custom framework).\n\nThe reliability of `poc.c` is very high, around 80%, whereas`ps4.c` is not very high, I guess around 20%.\n\n## Impact\n\n- In conjunction with a WebKit exploit, a fully chained remote attack can be achieved.\n- It is possible to steal/manipulate user data.\n- Dump and run pirated games.","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false,"attachments":[],"user":{"id":319901,"username":"serv","name":"s","bio":"","cleared":false,"website":null,"location":"","created_at":"2018-07-30T18:21:23.048Z","url":"https://hackerone.com/serv","anc_triager":false,"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true,"user_type":"company","profile_picture_urls":{"small":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/Rs7SWj52yyghzz7wN6DUx7Dw/43e4513b9104ea0d68c9c096cea374ba8440dde3e027af5465c8771e8839a67c","medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/Rs7SWj52yyghzz7wN6DUx7Dw/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c","xtralarge":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/Rs7SWj52yyghzz7wN6DUx7Dw/c11036e2d3f8b05af4b5da5984ccdec6f786b763c8abceb4e68042e10dcdae85"}}},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
