This time it is much more simpler, but basically has the same outcome. \n\nEXPLANATION: When you create basic standard Vault and transfer money from your Main Wallet to the vault the balance doesn't \"lock up\", which means that even when the transfer is pending to the vault you are still freely able to transfer the balance to other btc wallets from your main wallet. Once you approve the transfer to Vault your balance would go into Negative resulting in balance manipulation.\n\nIf you have any more questions/concerns feel free to ask.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nDavid.","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-01-20T02:04:36.552Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-180711582.70191833,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":628289,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi David,\n\nDo you have any accounts that you've managed to put into this state that I could reference along with this ticket as I pass it along to an engineer?\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-10-22T08:35:59.784Z","updated_at":"2015-10-22T08:35:59.784Z","actor":{"username":"coinbase2","cleared":false,"url":"/coinbase2","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"coinbase","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":628368,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi coinbase,\n\nI tried on datokaa@gmail.com the account access is limited on it, but coinabse told me i can still keep going and try to find bugs.
