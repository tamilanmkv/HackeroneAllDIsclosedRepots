Please look this from another prospective. \n\nZomato is not only a food delivery app, it's an emotions for all food lover and blogger. People use this to write review, add photos, following other food lovers. Additionally for each review you will get some points. You can consider this as social networking site for food love similarly like fb and instagram.\n\nNow coming to attacking scenario:\n\nConsider yourself a food lover, who writes review for each place where you go. Add review, comments over others review. Also you like to add photos.\n\nYou are doing this for many years and now you are reputed food blogger and food lover in this community. You also check in statics in zomato application.\n\nNow what if some one get your mobile phone, or may be you have given your phone to your friend for ordering food.\nAnd accidentally or deliberately he deleted your account. And it's so easy he don't need to verify to zomato that delete call is originated form you or real user.\nNow, all the reviews, points, picture, everything got deleted. This is not only about user data it's about years of hard work. \n\nHope you understand my concern, I am attaching video POC for all process.--\nStep 1:- In video you can see, I login from testcybrot@gmail.com account. And under user profile I have set my name profile picture, food review, people I am following, Dineline etc. And my level points.   Please note other user can also see and follow me, they check my comment. I this account is of any well known food blogger then, the restaurant review and pics also helps others.\nReputation is also one fact here to consider. \n\nStep2:- Delete this account. \n\nStep 3:- Again login using same email address i.e testcybrot@gmail.com\n\nStep4: Now check all the followers, dineline, my review comments even my points all have been deleted permanently. In short all my handwork gone for ever.  \n\nPotential risk : In this scenario we can confirm, once a user is deleted all his record and pointers got deleted. So might me same user can use one time coupon again and again by delete and re signup his account.\n\n\nConsider this situation under information risk. And must be there some mitigating controls to address this risk.  Hacking is also protecting ourselves. Consider here some defensive mechanism for data loss. Also take reference from other applications, you will not find any reputed application that has a function of user deletion without re-authenticate user identity.
