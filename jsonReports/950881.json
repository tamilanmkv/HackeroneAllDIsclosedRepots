It's our user ID, and it's vulnerable for IDOR. So we can change any user's email address.\n\nAlso user IDs are sequential so an attacker can change all accounts' email.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1.Go to https://magazine.atavist.com/login and Login to your account\n  1. Go to https://magazine.atavist.com/cms/reader/account and open your proxy program \n  1. Change the email and click `Save`\n  1. In request, change the ID to your test account's ID\n  1.
