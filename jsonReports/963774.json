It was fixed quickly (Less than 1 hour) which was awesome to see. Being that this was reported through a seperate channel, and it is for Hey, I'm not even sure it would eligible here. Either way, it was a pretty neat bug becuase of its simplicity and clear impact (loss of revenue). \n\nAnyways, here it is:\n\nThere appears to be a bypass for the premium email address sign up. \n\nWhen signing up for Hey, I tried to obtain jp@hey.com, which prompted a Premium alert box that stated it would cost $999 per year. Since that wouldn't work for me, I tried 'jp  @hey.com' (two spaces), this worked without prompting me to accept that it was a premium email address. \n\nIt appears that the spaces are registered as characters, so it's not considered a premium domain (at 4 chars), but the spaces are stripped at a later step and I am given a two character premium email address for the same cost as a non-premium email address.\n\nNow, it appears I can lock this email address in for $99 per year just like a typical email address on the Hey platform.\n\n## Impact\n\nAt the time, the impact was that an premium account (less than 4 chars) could be registered for the non-premium price of $99, which is substantially cheaper than the $999 price tag.","bounty_amount":"337.0","formatted_bounty":"$337","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic Errors"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":957351,"file_name":"image.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/JrbvnFENNu4YPt3xtmv4CJhM?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22image.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27image.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQQUWX32YR%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T154612Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDI60ST6nG4q4laTSFldIqSXi%2FaRkkQyutm5GwT0cJIZgIhAOZhMg3jBlju6Int%2BeeUm1aiBO7rhlrQcLIk%2Bgf6D%2BEDKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwXNLBv9MILvVoorSoq1wOfX3WD6Q7XyleYeGc645Essao0xgUb9KvTqDMYcvHVGFjpYncM47xpmv3HMsu%2F5W1XrLh7mNNldxl0sp09zO40TE5Gv3tk2fKUJkR%2FD6XSYmqjjSQ1X8rpbrso174vGjaIUSzY97sO%2Fd37gH6ZpB7ew%2Fv3oEvinQIGLVJR0eRzLhiviACbbOMKLVbWbamWcEPt5JM%2BAi%2F9NdNl7YuEpr2x1Aba%2FQ7SrG7ebdm1DcE0lVqIqx0ztrFvl3nirCMo74N6ge1UFzEhWH44%2BFZEehSLzVwe3%2F%2FBZFO65bGyxbdcPGK84GPYyTmQ%2BjLOaldd7KqAdRhPjDfqVNtwC3oWvVdxRnK%2FoQIrzUgaia36mrU%2B9zb4%2FRhBIhVDxcpxUM1gkKjO26kCJizTpuEecHCYqUizMVCu%2BZHsHDBDtIkkSFfQ%2B2gv2sFyQKltKMSVLAEHz02kDaXPYdZgNpJpJb5mig7chRqoJheUFMk5FqS9E%2FlqeZ5JfW22b6sOCLD%2FEMKSDTLFHVl3btbPUCjyHfhmlMXnpBRHVIqKR1wYVgjD5A7%2FSBEWiHu7RrZzNRZghQJBq1L32qmueS8YHqpboqJLILIuPtnLxC99DFuXuovAM4duMqxEoPDhN0Mw3oyRiwY6pAEUCR%2BsNQPvZhxAQDP4H0mmjcS7kJOELluaCLhnFR0avdVxZaYB9x8Q%2B1vVVuMQVfHNSrjWJl4H%2Be5xJlQ6IIY3JmCIpBdpvoYal7a%2B64IuQyPvQqpHA3Ie7oP5I5O%2F9TxjNDzuk8S48F6Uu5xP3VWBG1thWt0Ez9VpERdwmSl9%2FKYIOOCQmgzrHUQhmsthA0Nah76KucMZDyOmhK8c6RFPBq%2BuQw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=f12b0ab10302d234babfea40c79b3999a476ac0ff44ef42c10c48087c3915442","file_size":38913,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2021-01-14T14:54:46.453Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-23331085.923947252,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":47,"voters":["th3hidd3nmist","fqdn","prophet","bibekshah","romesful","ali","aryan2808","sudi","rahulkadavil_","0xneutrall","and 37 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":4653,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.basecamphq.com","max_severity":"none"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8994272,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey!
