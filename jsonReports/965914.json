Thanks for submitting a report! Please replace *all* the [square] sections below with the pertinent details. Remember, the more detail you provide, the easier it is for us to triage and respond quickly, so be sure to take your time filling out the report!\n\n**Summary:** \n\nThe libuv's implementation of realpath is flawed on darwin and may cause buffer overflow.\n\n**Description:** \n\nlibuv's `realpath` implementation determines the buffer size with `pathconf` and fallback to `_POSIX_PATH_MAX` (256) if that fails for any reason (eg. `ENOENT`). However `realpath` requires a buffer of at least `PATH_MAX` (1024) bytes to be used, hence causes the buffer overflow if the resolved path is longer than 256 bytes.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. `LONG_PATH='/tmp/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/long/path/254B'`\n1. `SHORT_LINK='/tmp/short'`\n1. `mkdir -p \"${LONG_PATH}\"`\n1. `ln -s \"${LONG_PATH}\" \"${SHORT_LINK}\"`\n1. `node -e \"fs.realpathSync.native('${SHORT_LINK}/file-not-exist')\"`\n\n## Impact: \n\nCause node process to crash.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n- https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_nodejs/issues/1958\n- https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/2965\n- https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/2966\n\n## Impact\n\nGiven that nodejs on darwin are mostly desktop applications and used as developer tools, exploit this is very unlikely to cause more damage than an application crash.","bounty_amount":"250.0","formatted_bounty":"$250","weakness":{"id":3,"name":"Classic Buffer Overflow"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-10-17T19:17:04.362Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-31004964.05662889,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["luc1d","cs7","3m3m","adass"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":666,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/nodejs/node","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9164410,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@ashi009 would you like attribution when this goes out in a security release and if so could you provide what you'd like in terms of\n\nThank you to X who works at Y for reporting this vulnerability.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-09-08T21:25:41.903Z","updated_at":"2020-09-08T21:25:41.903Z","actor":{"username":"mhdawson","cleared":false,"url":"/mhdawson","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"nodejs","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9220201,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@ashi009 one last ping","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-09-14T19:42:56.458Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T19:42:56.458Z","actor":{"username":"mhdawson","cleared":false,"url":"/mhdawson","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"nodejs","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9232028,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@mhdawson Sorry for the late reply.
