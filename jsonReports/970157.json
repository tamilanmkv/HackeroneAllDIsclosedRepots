The below steps must be followed In order to reproduce the security vulnerability.\n\n  Security Vulnerability #1 - Update Victim's Password - Bypass old password by unrestricted rate limiting\n\n\n1.Go to Settings and Privacy -\u003e Accounts\n2.Click on Email -\u003e Password\n3.Enter any random password and Click on 'Next'\n4.Intercept the request the above request and send it to intruder\n5.Then select the position old password\n6.Then go in payload add password list \n7.Then start the attack bcoz of no rate limit the password bruteforcing is continue and find the correct password and update the old one\n\n**Resolution:** Apply the Rate Limitation \n\n\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n## Impact\n\nThis a serious security vulnerability, as It could lead to a hacker completely taking over the user's account by overriding twitter's security protocol as they could use this technique to bypass the password and it use to fully takeover the victim password","bounty_amount":"700.0","formatted_bounty":"$700","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2021-02-04T04:43:35.094Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-21553393.14661266,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":50,"voters":["pyrrhon","rivalsec","ali","1337fenrir","mattberg","realtess","0nlymohammed","mpandi","hotmuffin","brdoors3","and 40 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":1062,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.twitter.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9073186,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"POC video how to reproduce the issue","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-08-29T11:33:35.728Z","updated_at":"2020-08-29T11:33:35.728Z","actor":{"username":"a13h1","cleared":false,"url":"/a13h1","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/WF4RXe4ADyfcAKTyKx4SstNr/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9075654,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Any update..?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-08-30T03:19:56.463Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T03:19:56.463Z","actor":{"username":"a13h1","cleared":false,"url":"/a13h1","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/WF4RXe4ADyfcAKTyKx4SstNr/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9092936,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Thank you for your report @a13h1 \n\nWhen reporting rate limiting issues we generally need the following information about the tests that you performed:\n\n1.
