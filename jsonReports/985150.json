I am not sure if this is  intentional, but since it leads to potentially take over a shop, I'm reporting it.\n\nWithin he Point Of Sale application, a staff with full admin permissions can open the Point Of Sale channel using the embedded **Magage POS roles** link. By doing so and by using some nested links, it is possible to navigate up to the Plan \u0026 Permissions admin view giving him access to some store owner permissions:\n 1. Add staff account\n 1. Manage staff account\n 1. Update login service\n 1. Transfer ownership (requires the shop owner password but could be used to bypass the 2FA protection)\n\nGiven that, a POS staff with only Manage Role could escalate his privileges up to Full Permissions and potentially even take over the shop if knows the admin password.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Create a Staff with Full Permissions\n1. Create a POS user with only Manage Staff permissions\n1. From the Point Of Sale Application, log-in with the admin user then enter the PIN of the POS User from Step 2\n1. Go to **Staff**, select the staff with Full Permissions from Step 1 and change its PIN to 1234\n1. Lock the application screen and log back in using the 1234 PIN, giving you Full Permissions access within the Application\n1. Go to **Staff**, select any staff, edit its **POS APP ACCESS** and click on **Manage POS Roles**\n1. From the Roles listing page, open the Full Permissions staff's role and scroll at the bottom down so you can see the **Assigned Staff** section and click on the Staff\n1. Scroll at the bottom again and click on **Manage Shopify admin access**, this is opening up the staff page from **Plan and Permissions**.\n1. At the top of the page, click on breadcrumb navigation **Plan and Permissions** link bringing you to the `https://shop.myshopify.com/admin/settings/account`\n\nAt this point, as the Point Of Sale application is using the physically authenticated user, you're given access to store owner features as mentioned earlier.\n\n## Impact\n\nA staff with **Manager Staff Role** within the Point Of Sale application can escalate his privilege to a Full Permission staff and could potentially transfer the shop ownership by using the **Transfer ownership** link within the **Plans \u0026 Permissions** page.","bounty_amount":"1000.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,000","original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":8,"voters":["th3hidd3nmist","xploiterr","drsniper","th4nu_0x0","realtess","hakivvi","xplicit","hackmastro"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":37198,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"Shopify Developed Apps","max_severity":"medium"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9255726,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I was thinking about my report this morning and just wanted to bring up that I consider this one to be a different issue than [927146](https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user\u0026report_id=927146) as it demonstrates that there's actually no need to intercept the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header value to achieve privilege escalation.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-09-18T11:44:01.952Z","updated_at":"2020-09-18T11:44:01.952Z","actor":{"username":"francisbeaudoin","cleared":false,"url":"/francisbeaudoin","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/apkjpoNQK4P5JD7rCFCB2hcf/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"shopify","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9256020,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Hi @francisbeaudoin!\nJust to clarify - which account-owner only actions you were able to take through this method?\nThanks!
