This password allows me to authentication to https://█████.mil.\n\n**Description:**\n\nI have discovered a cleartext password stored within a javascript. This password allows me to authentication to https://███████.mil.\n\n\nTo confirm this vulnerability we will first navigate to https://███████.mil, you are now prompted to type a password. We will provide an incorrect password such as 'Password'.\n\n██████████\n\n███\n\nWe can confirm the password is invalid. However, reviewing the javascript data for '██████.chunk.js' we can confirm the authentication is validated based on a hardcoded password '█████████!'.\n\n███████\n\nWe can now confirm if we can access the staging web app using hardcoded password.\n\n██████\n\n███████\n\n## Impact\n\nBy knowing the password, it is possible to understand your password policy and structure which will encourage bruteforcing and password spray attacks in your environment.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Navigate to https://█████████.mil.\n2. Open your browser debugger by pressing F12.\n3. Click on Network and refresh the page.\n4. Open the javascript '██████████.chunk.js' and look for where the password is stored. You will see \"(n=prompt(\"Enter Password\",\"Password\"),o=\"██████;\" copy the password.\n5. Now close out your browser debugger and refresh the page and type the password in.\n6. You now have access to ████████.mil\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\nIf this staging web application needs to be password protected, you can refer to the following AWS documentation on how to properly setup basic authentication https://docs.aws.amazon.com/speke/latest/documentation/authentication.html.\n\nResources:\nhttps://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Use_of_hard-coded_password\n\n## Impact\n\nBy knowing the password, it is possible to understand your password policy and structure which will encourage bruteforcing and password spray attacks in your environment.","weakness":{"id":23,"name":"Use of Hard-coded Password"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":4,"voters":["foobar7","dastan_9408","iamcoolcat","ddqactf"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9335552,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
