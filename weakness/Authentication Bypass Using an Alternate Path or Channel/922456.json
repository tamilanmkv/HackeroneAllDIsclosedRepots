Bypassing this means the target site assumes your email is validated, and actually ends up signing you in with an non-validated email. This behavior can frequently lead to account takeovers in 3rd parties since they often use the email as an identifier, and fold all OAuth/manually created accounts into one. In my example I am going to demonstrate an account takeover on https://laravelshift.com/, however this concept is widely exploitable.\n\nIt should also be possible to use this technique to get into internal company using pages that just look for `@domain.com` in the email before allowing them access.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1) Create a Bitbucket or GitHub account with a random email, and login to https://laravelshift.com/. (We're seeding a victim account).\n2) In a different browser, create a new GitLab account with that same email but never confirm it.\n3) In that browser, visit LaravelShift and click \"Sign in with GitLab\", notice you land on a page that states you cannot complete the OAuth grant without validating your email.\n\nRun the following request in Burp replacing your cookies, CSRF token, and state parameter.\n\n```\nPOST /oauth/authorize HTTP/1.1\nHost: gitlab.com\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 354\nDNT: 1\nConnection: close\nCookie: [COOKIES]\n\nutf8=%E2%9C%93\u0026authenticity_token=[CSRF TOKEN]\u0026client_id=6dd35c52b02a99eca3454505c4b1f1fa761ad1125bcdccdbc1c290877ef25093\u0026redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Flaravelshift.com%2Fauth%2Fgitlab%2Fcallback\u0026state=[STATE VALUE FROM URL]\u0026response_type=code\u0026scope=\u0026nonce=\n```\n4) Notice the request succeeds with a 302 to LaravelShift with the `code`.\n5) Visit that URL and notice you get logged into the victim's account from step 1. This works since the GitLab email is assumed to be trusted and validated.\n\n### Impact\n\nAccount takeovers on 3rd parties due to developers assuming GitLab is properly checking validated emails.\n\n### What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nIt's possible to play the `/oauth/authorize` request directly to bypass the `Verify the email address in your account profile before you sign in.` prompt.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nThe email verification check should be enforced at this step of the process as well.\n\n## Impact\n\nThanks,\n-- Tanner","bounty_amount":"3000.0","formatted_bounty":"$3,000","weakness":{"id":142,"name":"Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":215,"voters":["johnberzi","pyrrhon","sgt_","stardot","whitewhale-dmb","candoe","tolga","thaivu","xploiterr","lpi","and 205 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18138,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"gitlab.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8581383,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @cache-money,\n\nThank you for submitting this report!
