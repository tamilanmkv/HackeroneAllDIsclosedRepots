For example, https://wpwebsite.com/wp-admin/load-scripts.php?c=1\u0026load%5B%5D=jquery-ui-core,editor\u0026ver=4.9.1, file load-scripts.php will load jquery-ui-core and editor files automatically and return the contents of the file.\n\nHowever, the number and size of files are not restricted in the process of loading JS files, attackers can use this function to deplete server resources and launch denial of service attacks.\n\n(check references for more details about the vulnerability)\n2) attack details\n\n*affected link : https://www.formassembly.com/wp-admin/load-scripts.php\n\n*proof of concept ( description );\n\nthe load-scripts.php file was receiving a parameter called load[]. This parameter is an array that was receiving the names of the JS files that needed to be loaded.
