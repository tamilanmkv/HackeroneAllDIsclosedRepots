Unfortunately, when creating the named pipe server, the security descriptor is not set correctly, and as a result every user on the system can create pipe server instances. This allows for the following attack scenario:\n1.\tThe attacker creates a pipe server instance and waits for a client to connect to it.\n2.\tOnce a client is connected, the attacker connects to the real pipe server instance as a client.\n3.\tAt this point, the attacker is connected to the legitimate client and server, and can pass the messages back and forth, reading the messages (as they are passed in clear text) and possibly changing the messages.\n\nPlease see the attached report and POC tool for more information.\n\n## Impact\n\n- All the SQL requests/responses from the intercepted
