Regardless, www█████.affirm.com points to an AWS S3 bucket `affirm-prod-www-cms█████████` that no longer exists. I was able to take control of this bucket and put my own content onto it. I can now serve content on this domain, obtain a TLS certificate for this domain, etc.\n\nIf any customers or servers are pointing to anything within this domain, I could serve them arbitrary/malicious content. I could also use this in case your domain whitelists your own domain for OAuth, or if there are cookies scoped to the entire domain. Usually this can have a high impact.\n\n**Note:** S3 has a weird quirk where the bucket's region may cause errors if a request to a bucket is addressed to the wrong region. I assume your CDN points to `████-2`, but my bucket is in `us-east-1`. When you make a request to this domain, S3 shows a redirect error because of this. If I wanted to move the bucket to the correct region (for the PoC to fully work), it would put it at risk of being claimed by attackers/others. Hopefully, this is enough for you.\n\n### PoC\nTo see that the domain points to the `affirm-prod-www-cms█████` bucket:\n\n```\n% curl https://www██████████.affirm.com\n[...]\n\u003cCode\u003ePermanentRedirect\u003c/Code\u003e\n\u003cMessage\u003eThe bucket you are attempting to access must be addressed using the specified endpoint.
