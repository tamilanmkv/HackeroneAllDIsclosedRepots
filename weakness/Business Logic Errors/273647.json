The attacker will receive all the Payment related emails and using forgot my password attacker can takeover the account. \n\n# PoC \nKindly find the attached screen shot. \n\n# Patch\nOn the line number 314 the application updating the table without verifying that, \"the requested email address is already exists in the database and assigned to other account\".  \n\nhttps://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/blob/04b85c20c681eab433e021fb9ce7d7a4258c7202/gratipay/models/participant/email.py#L314\n\nThe simple patch would be verifying the space encoding characters and also verifying the account is already exists in the database and assigned to the other account. \n\nIf you have any question or you need video PoC then let me know I'll prepare it separately. \n\n\nCheers.
