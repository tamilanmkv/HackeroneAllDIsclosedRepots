(see image below)\n\n{F282541}\n\n\n---\n### Now how to exploit it ? , very easy.. hackerone will do it for you fully automated without any user interaction\n---\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nAssumes that you don't have any invites (as in 0 invites)\n\n  1. First step you have to find program with `security@` email forwarding enabled on hackerone, this is easy just go to https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs, click all the program and send a test email to their declared `security at` email on their public page, if you received a response to submit your bug, then that means `security@` is activated in hackerone.  \n███████\n\n  2. Lets take `███████`, send a test mail to that address\n  3. You will received an invitation email via `security@` email forwarding feature.\n  4. Click the __Submit Vulnerability__ , you are now a participants.\n  5. Now leave the program and fill-up the leave survey then confirm leave.\n  7. You'll be fast-tracked for invites, invitation will come most likely arriving in the next 24 hours as stated.\n  8. __REPEAT STEP 2 to 7__ after getting a new invite came from fast-tracked invites.\n\n__NOTE:__ Ask more information if you are having trouble understanding my submission.__\n\nBut this is easy to exploit, just send an email to: `██████ \u003e get invites \u003e leave to ██████████ \u003e get new invites came from fast-tracked \u003e repeat`\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can harvest all private invitation without any user interaction, in a matter of few months you can have 100+ private invitation by just daily repeating the steps i provided above.\n\n__INVITES ALL YOU CAN__\n\nLet me know if you need more information.\n\nCheers\nJapz","bounty_amount":"2500.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,500","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic Errors"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":282541,"file_name":"invitation_queu.JPG","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/282/541/2f4bf702d8935aea470779b5a06f57b17c86f7c0/invitation_queu.JPG?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22invitation_queu.JPG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27invitation_queu.JPG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fjpeg\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQX46P3UGI%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T144716Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIGvlFSN4tPhAu4V7v5pc7%2F6eSiik7IhHLLD01kiqhVWYAiB5Dz9ea%2BLZD%2BpLtagj4O%2BjrW%2FPBVXyOw%2FvfPhYOWnLJyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMy2N4EHiSo%2FA9G2F0KtcDeo3CuylmH%2BuFka3rGPAArFX7PEojyq8EAAWPijF4XtZGXNXpmeQR1pzTOcI0Rm%2Fvja%2BwHd%2F8TxJsGVWeh%2Flk5vjiIRZT9GPW9u3ZycCrjqMci9iGhBM6uwkYQOmABA3poTj0CyTV9vU5PwMEPHFcEacwKutRiCveofJe7f8Tu4WHR%2BNU7KEmxqtXpvAXj8hQLxFVDU25WgaPgk2b4mSQSaY%2FPywLP4TuBkCMbSNVoBG2JTX5CaBeJN5iElkzZ62K%2FGVGXrbaaNyPhn%2BB8rXIjbw78eQJEkHjvT8OqfCHAYP5f%2B4IhYfTll35nE7LIUoMiLvBq6tkN5BWqoopu%2Fpju60lSqB656qlcZeAK9f5orDqJzDwlKMnoVzqvkUrUy9bmk%2BkxGW97VVmeHZ1t0v3wof%2BrT0QSrWeBO35JesCQ%2BdFE8O%2BxosSdP7tU4A%2BDPpxwomZQHAAcNR9Aywt%2FQ8Qbv894mkGzt9WDwY%2FFN8jeU3O6C%2BmyqjrgMf7nGycFeD87%2Bsgs8CikLj6%2BhBYFpskae2EppYXvqHFDwWaJKFLdI8X3NNsrRpCnIXL5GUe8p%2BBySjVvE4SnyaxoJD5sUMGcJj0QQyQGgO22eUI1ATV1DsO%2BN%2BaLLxtMPqIkYsGOqYBTa91vvmG%2BK28LWqLSYG8vhMxYQ%2Fxj6PD70iq5MyM9pLPu1bgCyqJfX2mwm9fHA6UDqgGoerI%2Bnp3Q6V4OYY0E3hEAx7T8Q%2FppO8G%2BTgH7gaNlLC%2Fng4%2BkFoIuXyVGb7q1PCueRn4pqAqwTocflxXYcQQGudKiKkzrNHGy4UeULO76lDgSIcMEtI1vIJ76b2MxFEJwq4lWhln09Xn3ksb8maUXRDeCg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=c0bc86c584084a28b030adda96c37b8926af429e49c9271aa6973a07cac65c9e","file_size":49295,"type":"image/jpeg"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-05-17T19:59:29.031Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-107376467.42059352,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":90,"voters":["is-","jokebookservice1","sp1d3rs","kapytein","michiel","muon4","bl4de","spam404","flashdisk","yumi","and 80 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":6.1,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2573258,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportTitleUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-04-06T11:26:52.568Z","updated_at":"2018-04-06T11:26:52.568Z","additional_data":{"old_title":"Harvesting all private invitation using leave program fast-tracked invitation and security@ email forwarding feature","new_title":"Harvesting all private invites using leave program fast-tracked invitation and security@ email forwarding feature"},"actor":{"username":"japz","cleared":false,"url":"/japz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/078/347/38b576ad263c5255e136ebbd3a19eb61ff7a298d_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2575322,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugDuplicate","message":"Hi @japz - thanks for your report!
