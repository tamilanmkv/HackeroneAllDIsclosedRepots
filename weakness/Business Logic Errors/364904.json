This means the final amount reported by show_transfers will be the actual amount received multiplied by the number of duplicate tx pubkeys present in the transaction extra field.\n\nProbably does not work if the recipient expects an integrated address, since someone stripping the payment id and contacting support would be unlikely, so priming the exchange to be suspicious.\n\nThis was found by investigating a bug report: https://github.com/monero-project/monero/issues/3983.\n\nA simple patch fixes this: keeping track of pubkeys already scanned for, and skipping those that were already scanned.\n\n## Releases Affected:\n\nCurrent master and release versions.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. duplicate the \"add_tx_pub_key_to_extra(tx, txkey_pub);\" line as many times as wanted in src/cryptonote_core/cryptonote_tx_utils.cpp\n2. send a transaction to an exchange, without payment id (so it doesn't get processed automatically)\n3. give the tx details to the support person, telling them to check show_transfers for the amount\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\nSending wallet sending 5 (difficulty was set to 100 for ease of mining on an offline testnet):\n\n[wallet 9yvGzy]: transfer 9zcJy2vKeDzCWJXgDApGP3ee1YJvUNWS7UQ9Vn33HT4aSyXKrE9Fs2YCCtGMo7NbuE7zzvYZADkU3SgScqxkkLwnNR1wJdn 5\n\nTransaction 1/1:\nSpending from address index 0\nSending 5.000000000000.
