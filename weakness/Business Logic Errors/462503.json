The problem is that GitLab currently assumes that packages have been uploaded to a registry by default. For example, if no `homepage` key is pointing to GitLab in a `package.json` file, Gitlab assumes that the package has been uploaded to the npm registry. This not always the case, in fact, I have come across many packages that were defined for local use only and never published â€” this can be seen on multiple popular projects belonging to Facebook. To demonstrate my point I picked one of your projects and claimed the package on npm, so now if users navigate to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitter/desktop/blob/master/package.json and click on `gitter-desktop`, they will be redirected to my \"malicious\" npm module where there are clear instructions on how to install the package.\n\n{F390411}\n\n```html\n\u003cdiv class=\"blob-viewer\" data-type=\"auxiliary\"\u003e\n   \u003ci aria-hidden=\"true\" data-hidden=\"true\" class=\"fa fa-cubes fa-fw\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\n   This project manages its dependencies using\n   \u003cstrong\u003enpm\u003c/strong\u003e\n   and defines a package named\n   \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/gitter-desktop\"\u003egitter-desktop\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\n   \u003ca target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\"\u003eLearn more\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n```\n\nnpm modules are particularly dangerous since by design, npm executes certain scripts from dependencies during the installation process as demonstrated in https://hackerone.com/reports/399166 and https://vince-uploaded.s3.amazonaws.com/static/vulcoord/files/319816_attach_npmwormdisclosure.pdf.\n\nI would also like to add, it is really easy to automate this hijacking process and I would be more than happy to demonstrate an exploit on my own personal GitLab instance where I can claim lots of these package links in various test projects, if you are interested.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn adversary can trick an unsuspecting user into installing and executing a malicious package from the npm registry. What makes this attack possible is the fact that the package appears to belong to a trusted entity due to GitLab linking to the malicious packet from the project's page.\n\n\\- Ed","bounty_amount":"1000.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,000","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic Errors"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":390411,"file_name":"Screenshot_from_2018-12-14_18-37-27.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/390/411/4410f047c1d6682bd0a34f56fca7cd78683e7347/Screenshot_from_2018-12-14_18-37-27.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Screenshot_from_2018-12-14_18-37-27.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Screenshot_from_2018-12-14_18-37-27.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQSEHZZ6G7%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T150235Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCICgcJulSRaAJ%2FlV4SEWAQTyL4zo08LbSxF3YkMq%2FNlQPAiEAwYnoA1Ejs7bfAWoTffEddff%2B50LJlobfOVtd1RM%2FYnEqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDNRRuPIe4WOmezSvuirXA0I2fovKepc%2Br2vRekK4MdhNGmdM4Pc0OuzIHNmi1YNhdeljOfmMGUcQHlPqei9TxAGt4a%2Bwb9xKRrQFaS2o2gwxQkFXonxhS2p2%2FCJsWYUo5r66Rt8sQTiLMsAQcSzSjjF4bWzRQlm%2FsXkyqmfct1BfShpBMKnI%2BGx4M48yQfNnfgyRoZjVuWMHzcNqo6i%2B3imvvfu1gDhHkBQgvqL6AhnkVsXPRp6bS08enQ%2B4LeWijQjUmlhVfE3gDt1zfAq%2Fe%2FxOw17jAAuZH4zvbU5%2FFtGrJy%2BmroOTUxv%2FmxiaS8mF368AXRZQT%2FQ%2BK1TgapuP6OgN2v4j35edAg5veKR5WdWsY0QgOpQDSxzsTc2OCErw7fYWcmQYeYhOLVSghUfUtkDG76jJaJQMd36SmC4L2sb2NQ06wkAJfvd6Xh2dj7rFd%2BeVtQEdiI0FpNpkr5AYIz9emwENChfGQLyYkIfW5YUmUZn7%2BrBuWRxITz%2B3soyUxqmlqH%2B32ar8fmBp4Ie0VZd5xxkyHz5L%2BO4aTQveejpP0KxMm2%2Flqz8faN%2FLDBmpyKrFPcJn0sktEBiYdZCKd%2FJMvehZSGrjjy%2F75WSa1FwB%2FTzTTFRrGtLtYGGYby7RdTaug%2BPMKTC2jZGLBjqlAW%2FqLgyIU3l7q2BIHZ9aOYbvAcm7k5gKph8EjMf6tXptYEaiHmQx1q5jFWsRXPiWMZbi4fKKkFbfrJI1NS%2FDW3ba%2FI9tKqyLv9ZB%2FyHxyGg3CQqjMAh5HPdI6A9scOywAto0wTVOHwkl9Ay%2BNQ%2BadpR1vVj4UXnFx6R7Mt2xHMMc188gMtdSb8CXyaP6RpR3xaP3OWl7wd9lKp0P5L%2BRwYyHexzCFA%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=4b26118de65e7ba9dc734e18730a679d664b8713cbbe081bd1239dde3a1dbd8e","file_size":15841,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-04-05T17:30:44.381Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-79479110.64876533,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":19,"voters":["8ayac","kapytein","bl4de","sameerphad72","dhakal_ananda","ali","eveeez","an0nym0us","x1m","cr4xerbik4sh","and 9 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18138,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"gitlab.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3827162,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @edoverflow,\n\nThank you for submitting this report.
