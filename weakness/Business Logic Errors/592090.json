But there's another one, which is through sending a support ticket. By this you can send message to a support and hope to help you out.\n\nThere is a bit problem in this process. 1.) The `email` parameter is letting you to send email to another user, which don't own. 2.) The `phoneNumber` parameter is controllable. You can add text upto 94 characters enough to fool a user.\n\n**How to reproduce**\nFirst you need to register a valid account. If you don't own a domain it's Ok. There's a way to bypass the check. Just intercept the post request on `https://api.trustpilot.com/v1/business-requests/signup?utm_source=sign_up_link\u0026utm_medium=business_login_page\u0026utm_campaign=login` and modify the `email` parameter to your preferred email. Once set, check your email and click the verify.\n\nIf you've follow above step, you will be redirected to `https://businessapp.b2b.trustpilot.com/#/claim/` and here's where the magic happens. On the bottom there's a link called `Fill out this form`. Fill up the form and intercept the request. The request looks like this:\n```\nPOST /v1/private/business-users/5cee035f00bf83001b207d67/activation/support HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.trustpilot.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0\nAccept: application/json, text/plain, */*\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nReferer: https://businessapp.b2b.trustpilot.com/\nContent-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8\nAuthorization: Bearer [reducted]\nApiKey: [reducted]\nContent-Length: 182\nOrigin: https://businessapp.b2b.trustpilot.com\nConnection: close\n\n{\"name\":\"test\",\"email\":\"[reducted]\",\"domain\":\"\",\"phoneNumber\":\". Please follow this link to verify https://e-corp.ord\",\"message\":\"test. pls ignore\",\"locale\":\"en-US\"}\n```\n\nFinal step is to modify the `email` and `phoneNumber` parameter. This is will send an email you a target user and let you add a malicious link in the email.\n\n\n\nPOC: F498456\n\n## Impact\n\nIDOR which leads a phishing email to target any users","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic Errors"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":498456,"file_name":"Screenshot_from_2019-05-28_23-18-23.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/498/456/608f53353e80dab2398e0f4e01ac60b5ac7edbb5/Screenshot_from_2019-05-28_23-18-23.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Screenshot_from_2019-05-28_23-18-23.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Screenshot_from_2019-05-28_23-18-23.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQTQR22CE2%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151219Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHylhpFJOF4pRe7XlaDX6z3BLEup%2BswnNkaACr%2Fwjwr8AiASjuyeD0TYwrZA5sOldf5eC6UQrO8hSHC9jNR%2BVNumhyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMfK%2BofD1wJOHYcOUJKtcDnC3f8Y3jglGs7z8YlxF9bdYkYlsSrPxEkx9hDqtH%2BQ3u1daZrwyM6F3WHlk0a%2BWNezGk%2FnRxFWuvgXlXXAEBaCUWEe1UXv97gs6KKr%2F4fZ92%2FH3VXeVMioYLi220Z8qDdmiwSK2Z%2FPfK0nlRhO3v9Ee3r3C7BMq5B4DRnfxp0cJyzU%2FHbMNzQNjyO%2BlGzreHCzcyKBe%2FoFAr2W6xbLokCINrIUxMnvI9Mxs7SraD%2FF2sZw8Ln4uZ6aJweQoOPwsnYKkrRjb370Lt%2FREkrEj9pcgae0C9R5BTZegZaqNN6CzMkZfNHB7RmNrhJFg6j7%2BfPYLcWFNxzvJV9dbVJdocqrM5Jmi3hE47KOBrMSGuFrCha2vRk9P64hqfhM1GdDtMLFZZn5VqOJgdyVWZ8bTrZpmlBP%2FJ6YiHIaMTH8G%2FRndaRrVRAR8iOSqWok%2FikWajxMvcVA29H%2F5RznwCFPkLrSbv34tOiWcwVp50Yy3HjkGq4LnY67LMRRRIwThQ9vc%2BM3G9xlb7TwO6%2F3vE5U6azDCH6hDFQ3Xi8ZJVYrTOOWINnf%2BC3BIhvL8Uql%2FhI1vUmbQiAR01xN%2FdEQ9ReTSo0pfJ3SDSXhBXiwUW0IRKspJO189rJyI3MImNkYsGOqYBwdOGh60JXyl1FPj8jwEbnfg6var6H0hyaUwn%2B%2FnamMWODqDwoSJI6f0Q6RJHnQJo2gfc6OFgj1W2B%2FGcJDL4gMvwPBD8bBDDMSaZ3x1nqw%2FhzMwsaQP%2BTnUJEKAVQSe3o5Yvwzg%2FSvpNP%2By981FbIZs9aWoGNPHY48ZIUNdNLCWPS2PxNm9xHrAxEcqn8ib1XLvQQS%2FALl2CG36%2BewUP2tPIf%2BIPmw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=8fac8b60a625c8ea60652b6a2fae8cb6ac211a9b6d66b6632f2708678aa6fea6","file_size":148407,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":43,"voters":["wi11","hexpwn","ahmd_halabi","mik317","ali","ronr","mansoor0x01","parasimpaticki","eveeez","r0hack","and 33 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.7,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"physical","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"low"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":21519,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*api.trustpilot.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4949549,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @qwerty01,\n\nThank you for your submission.

The only involvement is that your staff will reply to that support request without knowing that the request was not sent by the target. \n\nThis bug may have impact to your reputation by sending malicious email to everyone.\n\nRegards,\n@qwerty01","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-05-31T13:07:21.064Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T13:09:24.159Z","actor":{"username":"secnugget","cleared":false,"url":"/secnugget","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/UFURpMi4MxAVynK33SLeHEJS/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"trustpilot","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4960640,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"If you're not convinced in my explanations, I would highly suggest, not to allow the system to send an auto reply email to anyone but the currently logged in user.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-05-31T13:29:48.420Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T13:29:48.420Z","actor":{"username":"secnugget","cleared":false,"url":"/secnugget","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/UFURpMi4MxAVynK33SLeHEJS/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"trustpilot","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4966407,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @qwerty01,\n\nThanks for the follow-up, I will go ahead and check with the Trustpilot's internal team and will get back to you as soon as I hear back from them.\n\nYour patience is much appreciated.\n\nRegards,\n@nasr0x01","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-01T17:43:14.784Z","updated_at":"2019-06-01T17:43:14.784Z","actor":{"username":"nasr0x01","cleared":false,"url":"/nasr0x01","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/386/674/ec2e2c825a554851c42c122ffd61aa8f18b08174_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"trustpilot","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4966408,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugReopened","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-01T17:43:28.740Z","updated_at":"2019-06-01T17:43:28.740Z","actor":{"username":"nasr0x01","cleared":false,"url":"/nasr0x01","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/386/674/ec2e2c825a554851c42c122ffd61aa8f18b08174_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"trustpilot","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5024893,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-07T11:40:17.942Z","updated_at":"2019-06-07T11:40:17.942Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Medium","new_severity":"Low (3.7)","old_severity_id":404618,"new_severity_id":415798},"actor":{"username":"aleksandr_borkun","cleared":false,"url":"/aleksandr_borkun","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"trustpilot","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5024946,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@qwerty01 Hi!
