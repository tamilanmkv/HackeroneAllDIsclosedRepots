So first you need to identify the message initial date, send a message in the support section, intercept its request and see the response containing the target date.\n\n```\n█████████\nHost: support.cs.money\n\n{\"user_steamid\":\"id-number\",\"text\":\"test\",\"settings\":{\"skin_exterior\":0,\"eco\":0,\"unavailable\":1,\"hints_in_trade\":1,\"lock_skin\":0,\"popup_skin\":1,\"reserved_skin\":1,\"save_filter\":0,\"virtual_trade\":0,\"skins_ticker\":1,\"beautiful_pics\":1,\"skins_float\":0,\"rarity\":0,\"collection\":0,\"conveyor\":1,\"block_red_points\":0,\"sourcePay\":\"scrill\"},\"bot_mode\":\"trade\",\"user_mode\":\"trade\"}\n```\n\n██████\n\n'2. Say that you no longer are able to edit the above message created by you. So now create another message. Click edit, send the message and intercept its request.\n'3. Add the date value from the step 1 response in the `date` value, and add the new message content in the `new_message` value.\n\n```\n███████\nHost: support.cs.money\n\n{\"date\":\"date-value\",\"new_message\":\"Hackerone edited message changed successfully === bug\"}\n```\n\n'4. Forward the request and see the response code id 200 OK, Reload the page and see that the message is edited successfully.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\nPlease see the video below where I explained the bug step-by-step.\n\n█████\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers are able to edit their old messages that are not supposed to be editable anymore. This can lead to serious issues because they are being edited on the server too.\nAlso this is a bypass for the application validation and violation of its protection.\nI think this can lead to serious problems if malicious users edit the messages to bad or harmful content.\n\nBest Regards.","weakness":{"id":65,"name":"Business Logic Errors"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":7,"voters":["najeh_halawani","sheikhrishad0","amad3u6","what_web","01alsanosi","dnelsaka","eingengraou"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":45903,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"support.cs.money","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9417952,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Hey!\nThis issue is already reported in #995664.\nStill, as we've told in the original report, we can't see direct security impact here.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-05T09:34:06.805Z","updated_at":"2020-10-05T09:34:06.805Z","actor":{"username":"triage_team","cleared":false,"url":"/triage_team","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/8YgxVBkgWzPrnmtFYUro9KKb/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"cs_money","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9418099,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Let me explain little more about the impact :\n- First it is a bypass and violation of the security system that you designed to disallow edit messages after certain time.\n- Second, this will cause investigation issues and clients may write things for the support and when the support answer a thing, the client can re edit his messages through this bug and answer the opposite for example which will be returned back as a bad thing done for the support with that client.\n- This bug also abuses support section since the messages are taken seriously when it comes to forensics investigations. If some bad situation happened they wont understand that there is a bug there and the client changes the messages.\nSo malicious clients can abuse these messages for their side and cause some issues to your company when it comes to law especially if the support answered specific things in the messages and the malicious client edited his messages.\n\nAt the end in real case scenarios you are talking about hackers (black hats) where they try to make large exploitation through small bugs they find in your system. Don’t you think this should be resolved ?\n\nThat’s why I put the severity as high since it may lead to serious issues which not necessary to be technical issues, they can be business, communication and investigation issues.\n\nI hope that you think about the impact of this bug taking in consideration all the circumstances.\n\nKind
