This can enable a buffer overflow attack, using the source buffer that keccakf passes to bc, at line 73 of core-master\\src\\lib\\sha3.c, to overwrite the target buffer. \n \n\nAlternatively, the vulnerability could be the result of improper bounds checking; exposing internal memory addresses outside of their valid scope; allowing the attacker to control the size of the target buffer; or various other forms. \n\n \n\nKindly confirm and revert in case of any queries.\n\n## Impact\n\nImpact:\n\n \n\nBuffer Overflows can manifest in numerous different variations. In its most basic form, the attack controls a buffer, which is then copied to a smaller buffer without size verification. Because the attacker's source buffer is larger than the program's target buffer, the attacker's data overwrites whatever is next on the stack, allowing the attacker to control program structures.","weakness":{"id":3,"name":"Classic Buffer Overflow"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":6,"voters":["apapedulimu","bb00x","0619","tomas_savenas","sneakysnake","takeshy"],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":42899,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/dovecot/core","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2791311,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"This is rather specialized SHA3 code that isn't very easily readable, but hash algorithms' code rarely is, especially because it often is rather performance critical.
