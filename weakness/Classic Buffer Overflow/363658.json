In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. Writing outside the bounds of a block of allocated memory can corrupt data, crash the program, or cause the execution of malicious code. \nFor better refernce:\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_Overflow\n\nPOC:\nGo to\nhttps://liberapay.com/sign-up\nNow type(copy and paste using python) email address of size more than 100mb or in gbs and sign up.\nAfter signing up for few times u will receive this error as shown in sent pic.\n\nSteps to resolve:\nRestrict size limit on input parameter.\n\n## Impact\n\nCategory:Availability: Buffer overflows generally lead to crashes. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.\n    Access control (instruction processing): Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary code, which is usually outside the scope of a programâ€™s implicit security policy.\n    Other: When the consequence is arbitrary code execution, this can often be used to subvert any other security service.","weakness":{"id":3,"name":"Classic Buffer
