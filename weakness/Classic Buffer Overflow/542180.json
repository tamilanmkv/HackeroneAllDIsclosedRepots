Download the attached c1m1_hotel.nav\n2. Place it in your *\u003csteamapps\u003e/Left 4 Dead 2/left4dead2/maps/* directory\n3. Start up Left4Dead 2 and attach a debugger\n4. Enter \"map c1m1_hotel\" into the developer console\n5. Observe that EIP becomes 0x41414102, indicating that a buffer overflow has occurred and code execution is possible\n\n## Operating Systems Tested\n- Windows 10 1809 Build 17763.437\n\nI have not tried this for MacOS or Linux, however I assume it would work on both of those platforms as well if they all share the same codebase as the Windows executable.\n\n## Notes\nBecause Left4Dead 2 ships on Windows with a non-ASLR enabled module (binkw32.dll), it is much easier to write up a working exploit for this vulnerability as you no longer need an additional infoleak of some kind to do serious damage and can just use ROP.\n\n## Impact\n\n## Impact\nIf an attacker successfully exploits this vulnerability, the attacker can run arbitrary code on the machine of a victim.\n\nDue to the fact that Source supports sending arbitrary files to clients when connecting to a server, it is possible that you could create a fake dedicated server that does nothing but send the malformed NAV file to clients who are connecting, creating a remote code execution scenario.\n\nAnother attack scenario would be an attacker uploading a campaign map with a malformed NAV to the Steam Workshop, and convincing other users to download it. When they download it and load the campaign in game, arbitrary code will be executed on their machines.","bounty_amount":"10000.0","formatted_bounty":"$10,000","weakness":{"id":3,"name":"Classic Buffer Overflow"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":471665,"file_name":"c1m1_hotel.nav","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/471/665/f7d98a25135d6c4f7231c194d52222d46801b3d2/c1m1_hotel.nav?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22c1m1_hotel.nav%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27c1m1_hotel.nav\u0026response-content-type=application%2Fx-mach-binary\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ5B5ZLR7W%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151015Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDznwDn3DlLBhpUQR2HsgV%2FXq95UR4rgunTAtaALtJfOwIhAPs6S1Tcddn1VigtqMJZu1ze7EJhUESTAidgv9nNGvTkKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwZmyQg19q82eNvWTYq1wPVa9iL33aSnxoe9uhB7r2aVM0UjDJv7L7h4wpacx0zTD7Cg8zZaNStfUkAQ4PRdT1iVaYXFqr3oEtcRoGLKhag7I7AYV4CfabHIx%2FljtUdbse7EzqrV%2BLQvKbTG6z1i6zNoig4BjAmqV%2BbJNhSJroBCOPElku0SEqEghibUoxjbjpR4CBXjTIJwAUpnCgLLy91sSgp9KNeTgb1AkQk9PEiYIt%2BjjRn7YHGTo0lsLEhUWc0hsx6VLMRCiSyU6pMLzMGyTS6q7VECFtTn5Z0xG6cXCTKHB3pYQ1zLLYN8ml68bLOIBj9DG3soHxXVeXkifKnxu13VQyp3%2Fs7gxFDt1C7HjJ71usGGrh%2BfYBJJFBMGndfS1DoK%2Bopk8YhA2hlX3szEJmyZfm0KUVaG%2FoWbCJlR3fqXIBJ1cKXRlMooUSiLaTSXt07k2ZqF9w0HUl1IdVQzbNbJBH%2BnkPxpioMdR%2BthDqTyEJ4NZO1WuIxKWGZYyMyXsZaWNopcb1ntUTbg6h9jL8PBR4KRpM%2FHAsw70cht3GV%2BEt83AJHQMRTRifsEIkEWjFR47llnjXkbbepxcng%2ByfEEKZRp237bvaIzCz%2FOBASo1zhQretKmelA0U4%2BEADJwrI3hIwr4yRiwY6pAEjctaIC5qKHFIiVu1bdWXuftBXGyVKZyt2TIP%2B2%2FEEDUKSn7h674C0WnV7bDgpkWP3Jm2QA8%2B4oAW2qew892kEhCJxDwZz%2BXR81EJw6%2FG5A5FZJ8bUl63WLiuBkwA0Dx%2Bf%2FkeTcR6awW4gpgHN5q2%2B02FvrdW8HWnLO9b%2FdddTJiHpMjGB2dteCQWg1L0LIQ%2FyL7kCQpQu%2F5PLB76pfiUetgXbFQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=31c0b6ccac01a209b6e715962fe203b043d04601d66c1967964ceaa01c0bcb9d","file_size":545129,"type":"application/x-mach-binary"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":261,"voters":["rapiddns","njbooher","arm4nd0","sebd","sgabe","jeti","is-","leonm","mvc","mashoud1122","and 251 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","score":9.0,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":1290,"asset_type":"DOWNLOADABLE_EXECUTABLES","asset_identifier":"*.exe","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4597476,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @hunterstanton,\n\nThank you for your submission.

I had a section in my notes with some more detailed info however it slipped my mind to include it when I was writing up my report.\n\nI do not have an in-depth technical analysis due to not having the source code available for Left4Dead 2. Due to the fact that the buffer overflow location in navigation meshes is a large amount of random integers and floats, it is difficult to even tell what the data is supposed to be. \n\nHowever, I can tell you that the overflow specifically occurs in server.dll shipped with the latest build of Left4Dead 2 on Windows. The function 0x102E57B0 calls 0x104E3EA0 and during the execution of 0x104E3EA0, a buffer is overflown causing eax to become an arbitrary value, and then a *call eax* instruction is executed, allowing control of the EIP register.\n\nI greatly apologize for not having more information. There aren't any obvious strings in functions in the call chain that would give a hint as to the actual name of the buffer that is overflowing or what structure it is a part of. I tried to find information about it on [Valve's Source SDK code on GitHub](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013) however I don't believe the vulnerable code in question is in that repository.\n\nThanks,\nhunterstanton","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-04-19T12:29:20.114Z","updated_at":"2019-04-19T12:29:20.114Z","actor":{"username":"hunterstanton","cleared":false,"url":"/hunterstanton","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/006/057/5f4d182836910825ea65d4f94955ee5f47129b41_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"valve","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4598182,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-04-19T13:19:43.048Z","updated_at":"2019-04-19T13:19:43.048Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Critical","new_severity":"Critical (9.0)","old_severity_id":351116,"new_severity_id":351622},"actor":{"username":"pieceoftoast","cleared":false,"url":"/pieceoftoast","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/304/250/1d56f264cfce92a8f88b8424ce9dc273ab4bcd63_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"valve","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4598185,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for the additional information @hunterstanton!
