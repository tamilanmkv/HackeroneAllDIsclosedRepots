With phishing, the victim navigates to an untrusted URL, for example badooooo.com instead of badoo.com, and enters his details there. In the scenario I propose, the victim never navigates to an untrusted URL, and even at the time the victim enters his details, the address bar shows still http://www.odnoklassniki.ru.\n\nA HSTS header would make this scenario indeed harder to exploit, but that's not the issue I'm reporting. Even with a HSTS header present, it would still be good practice to link to the http rather than https version of odnoklassniki, as the user might not have visited odnoklassniki within the HSTS max age in the current browser. Note that we're not talking here about a user himself typing in a http URL, but the user being redirected to http from a https site, which the user is less likely to notice.\n\nScenario #2: As PoC, I uploaded the following video.
