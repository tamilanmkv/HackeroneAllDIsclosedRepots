Now, I can change the exploit here to do exactly that. All you have to do is download my PoC and open it locally and then I can execute chrome code after the user clicks anywhere or presses any keyboard button. So the difference of $100 between reading local files and RCE seems a bit too low for practically the same STR.\n\nFinally, I would like to leave you with this relevant video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meiU6TxysCg","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-04T07:36:13.977Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T07:36:13.977Z","actor":{"username":"qab","cleared":true,"url":"/qab","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3435615,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\"$750 was awarded as a bonus for pointing out that there is a system html file that can be used to trigger reflected XSS, assuming this file is not under the control of Brave then its not fixed by you.\" \u003c that's not actually why we gave the 750 bonus. We realized in light of other recent reports that we had severely underpaid (250) for an exploit that was RCE from the web with very little user interaction. The system HTML file issue he pointed out didn't have an impact on this decision.\n\nYou have a good point that this is similar in complexity to #375329 but has more impact.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-04T18:44:42.436Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T18:44:42.436Z","actor":{"username":"diracdeltas","cleared":false,"url":"/diracdeltas","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/115/616/4e2016543ea3e299dcadd088be7d0225de3419e0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3435617,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-04T18:45:16.491Z","updated_at":"2018-10-04T18:45:16.491Z","actor":{"url":"/brave","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/015/688/2aad5641af643ee4f4402896e4747293f6e9c5ca_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Brave Software"}},"bounty_amount":"150.0","bounty_currency":"usd","bonus_amount":"0.0","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","collaborator":{"username":"qab","url":"/qab"},"actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3437312,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"closing since https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/15261/ was merged","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-05T05:27:31.362Z","updated_at":"2018-10-05T05:27:31.362Z","actor":{"username":"diracdeltas","cleared":false,"url":"/diracdeltas","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/115/616/4e2016543ea3e299dcadd088be7d0225de3419e0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"qab","url":"/qab"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3466448,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Looks like this was fixed with latest Brave update.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-11T18:03:12.325Z","updated_at":"2018-10-11T18:03:12.325Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"qab","cleared":true,"url":"/qab","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3521840,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-23T19:13:25.197Z","updated_at":"2018-10-23T19:13:25.197Z","actor":{"username":"toml","cleared":false,"url":"/toml","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/229/717/56ea9edd04176aa3f29b215291bbc0b656699f67_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3521841,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-23T19:13:25.273Z","updated_at":"2018-10-23T19:13:25.273Z","actor":{"username":"toml","cleared":false,"url":"/toml","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/229/717/56ea9edd04176aa3f29b215291bbc0b656699f67_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
