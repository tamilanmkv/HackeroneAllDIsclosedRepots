The Rails stack prior to 4.2 when calculating `request.remote_ip` uses [these regular expressions](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/4-1-stable/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb#L31-38) to strip out trusted Proxies from the HTTP Headers `X-Forwarded-For` and `Client-IP`.\r\n\r\nDue to this parser differential an attacker might bypass the Web Console IP whitelist by supplying a HTTP header value of:\r\n\r\n`X-Forwarded-For: 0000::1` \r\n\r\nThis IPv6 address in the given notation would bypass the `TRUSTED_PROXIES` entry `^::1$` but match the `IPAddr` value of `::1` within Web Console.\r\n\r\nAs the Web Console is *intended* for debugging in the Development Environment this will most likely not affect Production setups, unless Web Console is explicitly enabled. But gaining RCE on Developer laptops might be fun as well ;).\r\n\r\nI've already sent a description of this to the Rails Security Team via mail, but I've been asked to submit here again. \r\n\r\nThe easiest mitigation of this issue would be to disallow execution of Web Console within Rails \u003c 4.2.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-07-16T19:16:20.836Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-196890273.84998414,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":9,"voters":["sw33tlie","dee-see","c1phy","an0nym0us","exception","japz","cryptographer","lxth0rz","nebelschwaden"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":315285,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi There,\n\nThanks for submitting this via email, I can confirm we've received it and will be in touch in the next 24 hours or so with an eta","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-01-21T21:03:28.035Z","updated_at":"2015-01-21T21:03:28.035Z","actor":{"username":"nzkoz","cleared":false,"url":"/nzkoz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/317/11e8edc22329e340906e362e4f8d431cd6797787_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":319802,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Seems like 24 hours was a bit too optimistic ;).\n\nCan I get a short heads up?\n\nThx!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-01-28T17:57:05.629Z","updated_at":"2015-01-28T17:57:05.629Z","actor":{"username":"joernchen","cleared":false,"url":"/joernchen","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/075/5c3bb9f26b9116faa19b35d813ae411be62433e5_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":328348,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@joernchen we are still discussing the better way to fix this issue.

whitelist bypass in Web Console \n\nThere is a remote code execution vulnerability in Web Console. \nThis vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2015-3224. \n\nVersions Affected:  All \nNot affected:       Environments inaccessible from remote IPs, or without Web Console enabled \nFixed Versions:     2.1.3 \n\nImpact \n------ \nSpecially crafted remote requests can spoof their origin, bypassing the IP whitelist, in any environment where Web Console is enabled (development and test, by default). \n\nUsers whose application is only accessible from localhost (as is the default behaviour in Rails 4.2) are not affected, unless a local proxy is involved. \n\nAll affected users should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately. \n\nReleases \n-------- \nThe 2.1.3 release is available at the normal locations. \n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nTo work around this issue, turn off web-console in all environments, by removing/commenting it from the application's Gemfile. \n\nPatches \n------- \nTo aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series.  They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset. \n\n* 2-1-ip-whitelist.patch - Patch for 2.1 series \n\nPlease note that only the 2.1.x series is supported at present.  Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. \n\nCredits \n------- \nThis vulnerability was reported by both joernchen of Phenoelit and Ben Murphy.  Thanks to each of them for reporting the issue to us and verifying the fix.
