Today, I am here because I want to report this issue because is a valid bug, and it's a fruit from my hard work.\r\n\r\nI saw that now all domain of trendrr has been shutting down except one, the onwewich I found to be vulnerable: the domain is support.trendrr.tv, that is an alias for trendrr.zendesk.com.\r\n\r\nI visited the TRENDRR support website and it says: \"No help desk at support.trendrr.tv\r\nThere is no help desk configured at this address. This means that the address is available and that you can claim it at http://www.zendesk.com/signup/\"-----\u003eHere a screen wich proof that: http://grabilla.com/05115-db455e78-830e-43dd-b562-c839672cb14e.html, So once it's expire I can claim it.\r\n\r\nAnd once claimed it, if you try to navigate with your browser to support.trendrr.tv  (Since this is an Alias (so is pointing out to a specific domain) for trendrr.zendesk.com as proof this screen: http://grabilla.com/05115-6d3ed6d5-494c-4c38-b0b6-3539e5161d6d.html ) you will redirect to trendrr.zendesk.com, that is my domain takeovered! :)\r\n\r\nPOC(s) of the subdomain takeover: \r\n\r\n1) http://grabilla.com/05115-27247cde-c11a-4dd0-a684-8d39ae5f4178.html\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n2) http://grabilla.com/05115-5e623c93-2657-4e45-a0af-4ff41593a4fc.html\r\n\r\nSince I have complete control over the subdomain I can do whatever I want on it, be careful about that!\r\n\r\nPs: Even if is an acquisition and most of TRENDRR domains has been shutt-down, I except a small bounty for this, or better...I hope! =)\r\n\r\nPlease fix it as soon as possible , and let me know if you need any further information.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nSimone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-02-21T15:11:01.620Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-209432995.2568576,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["sw33tlie"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":315328,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report.
