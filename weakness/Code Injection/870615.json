This information will help us to respond you more quickly and triage your report. Thanks a lot for your assistance.\n\nI use Translator, T_T Sorry\n\n**Summary**\ncan turn off anti-virus functionality in an external process.\n\n**Description**\nUse the SetWindowsHookEx function to inject the DLL. The ClientLoadLibrary was hooked to prevent injection, but dlls with specific file names were injectable(tiptsf.dll). After that, I was able to hook some WinAPIs and turn off antivirus.\n\n**Environment**\n- Scope: Application\n- Product name: Kaspersky Internet Security\n- Product version:20.0.14.1085\n- OS name and version (incl SP): Windows 10 RS5\n- Attack type: Bypass\n- Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no privileges\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n1. FindWindow and get hwnd from kaspersky internet security(avpui.exe)\n2. I have invoked the SetWindowsHookEx function to inject the DLL.\n3. After hooking the TrackPopupMenu function, send a pop-up message through PostMessage.\n4. When self-protection is turned on, it generates a new avpui.exe and then generates a Dialog that asks users to confirm. the generated process also injects dll.\n5. In the newly created avpui.exe, hook the IsDialogMessageW function and switch to a message that occurs when you click the OK button.\n6. download ransomware \u0026 run.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe bypass function can be used to turn off the antivirus before the malware is activated.","bounty_amount":"2000.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,000","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2021-04-30T08:10:53.186Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-14196341.014533697,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":14,"voters":["halove23","battle_angel","secator","th4nu_0x0","mattberg","f_m","grisboublik","za_sec","horus05","iamcoolcat","and 4 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":7977027,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportTitleUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-05-12T15:45:45.472Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T15:45:45.472Z","additional_data":{"old_title":"can turn off anti-virus functionality in an external process.","new_title":"KAVKIS is vulnerable "},"actor":{"username":"artem_baranov","cleared":false,"url":"/artem_baranov","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/257/241/2e90c2393e57c257791b2e8deb7c0a43607a1315_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"kaspersky","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7977056,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportTitleUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-05-12T15:49:18.101Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T15:49:18.101Z","additional_data":{"old_title":"KAVKIS is vulnerable ","new_title":"A vulnerability in KAVKIS 2020 products family allows full disabling of protection"},"actor":{"username":"artem_baranov","cleared":false,"url":"/artem_baranov","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/257/241/2e90c2393e57c257791b2e8deb7c0a43607a1315_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"kaspersky","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7977059,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-05-12T15:49:34.307Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T15:49:34.307Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":null,"new_severity":"Medium","old_severity_id":null,"new_severity_id":718980},"actor":{"username":"artem_baranov","cleared":false,"url":"/artem_baranov","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/257/241/2e90c2393e57c257791b2e8deb7c0a43607a1315_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"kaspersky","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7977062,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportVulnerabilityTypesUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-05-12T15:49:50.823Z","updated_at":"2020-05-12T15:49:50.823Z","additional_data":{"added_weaknesses":[{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"}],"removed_weaknesses":[]},"actor":{"username":"artem_baranov","cleared":false,"url":"/artem_baranov","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/257/241/2e90c2393e57c257791b2e8deb7c0a43607a1315_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"kaspersky","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7977071,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Dear Kim Dong-Hyeon (abbadeed), \nOur team confirms the reproduction of this issue.
