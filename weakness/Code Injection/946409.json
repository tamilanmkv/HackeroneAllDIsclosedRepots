We will let you know by February 2nd if we have any concerns, clarifications etc. \n\nUnrelated to your blog post about python dependency confusion, I'd like to ask you about the npm packages that you claimed on npmjs.com. The packages we know that you claimed on npmjs.com include:\n\n* yelp-js-infra\n* yelp-bunsen-logger-js\n* yelp_sitrep\n\nCould you let us know how you identified those package names? As far as I'm aware, these packages are not referenced in any dependencies of open source projects or Yelp blog posts etc. \n\nBest,\nThe Yelp Security Team","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-01-22T01:56:38.621Z","updated_at":"2021-01-22T01:56:38.621Z","actor":{"username":"dpopes","cleared":false,"url":"/dpopes","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"yelp","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10449058,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @dpopes,\n\nThese names can be found inside javascript files, such as:\n\nhttps://s3-media0.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/public/module_biz_claim_pages_landing.yji-d31b8f13a3e9d210d83f.js\n\nJust to clarify, the npm side of things and this method of finding package names within javascript files will also be covered in the post.\n\nAlso, after having a look at the file again, I believe it is a perfect and clear example illustrating leaked internal package names, and I would like to add a screenshot of the javascript file linked above to my post (something along the lines of the attached picture).
