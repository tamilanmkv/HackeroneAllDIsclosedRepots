The Jenkins instance on ci.owncloud.[com/org] is vulnerabile for this attack since it is configured to run on a public IP address and is not firewalled.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the common library used by Java to (de)serialize data. Jenkins will deserialize and execute configuration data sent to a specific port it is listening on. More information on the vulnerability can be found in this [article](http://foxglovesecurity.com/2015/11/06/what-do-weblogic-websphere-jboss-jenkins-opennms-and-your-application-have-in-common-this-vulnerability/).\n\nIt was easy to find the Jenkins instance because its name is easy guessable (only later on I found out its also being linked to from your GitHub page).\n\n**POC**\nI used a payload to confirm the RCE which tells me ci.jenkins.org is running `Debian 7`. You can use this information as confirmation on the RCE.\n\nI was also able to read the `/etc/passwd` file, but I'd rather not send the data it contains in this report.\n\n**Mitigation**\n- Shut down ci.owncloud.com for the time being\n- Run ci.owncloud.com on a VPN instead of on a world-accessible public IP address\n- Firewall the Jenkins instance\n\nRegards, @tomdev","weakness":{"id":70,"name":"Code Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-12-09T06:42:58.803Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-184323933.29152915,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":8,"voters":["mashoud1122","an0nym0us","whitesector","lordjerry0x01","japz","visi0n","sudo-phantom","meispi"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":649857,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us.
