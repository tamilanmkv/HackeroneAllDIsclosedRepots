Since functions aren't escaped, the possibilities of using this can be limitless and can cause a severe impact. One example is having it execute malware on the user computer.\n#Steps to reproduce:\n1. Login to your partner account then go to https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/api_clients and create a new app.\n2. Go to `\u003cyour_store\u003e.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id=\u003capp_api_key\u003e\u0026redirect_uri=\u003capp_redirect_uri\u003e\u0026response_type=code\u0026scope=read_products%2Cwrite_products`\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\n**where The `\u003capp_api_key\u003e` is the api key of the app you have created through the partner account and the `\u003capp_redirect_uri\u003e` is the redirect url of it.**\n3. Now click `Install app` \n4. Go to `\u003cyour_store\u003e.myshopify.com/admin/settings` and change the store name to `-2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!D2` \n5. Go to `https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/api_clients/\u003capp_id\u003e/` then scroll down and click the `Export list of current users` button . then A CSV file will be sent to your email , open that file and you'll see that the cell is active and the command will be executed.\n\n####References: \n- https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSV_Excel_Macro_Injection\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/72785\n- https://hackerone.com/reports/90415\n\nThanks\n","weakness":{"id":58,"name":"Command Injection - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-12-31T21:05:38.286Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-182362233.83209258,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":2,"voters":["drsniper","spetr0x"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":692915,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for reporting this bug!
