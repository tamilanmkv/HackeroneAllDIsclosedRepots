Let's digest it bit by bit and see if it makes sense:\n\n1. A nonessential command line utility that simply selects a random file and tells you audit it for possible security risks \"is starting with \u003c?php and it should be with ?\u003e\".\n  * I take that back, breaking that into pieces doesn't offer any insight or clarity here.\n  * What would starting a PHP script with `?\u003e` even accomplish?\n2. \"any hacker like me can run HTML code on this page so you should close the source by \u003c?\"\n  * This isn't a web page, it's a command line utility.\n  * What does \"run HTML code on this page\" even mean?\n  * What do you mean by \"close the source by `\u003c?`\"?\n\n\u003e any updates sir ? it's has been 15 minute without any updates ! please fix it .. just add \u003c? and everything will be ok \n\nSo, one of three things happened here.\n\n1. Your account was hacked by someone looking to trash your reputation.\n2. You have no idea what you're doing.\n3.
