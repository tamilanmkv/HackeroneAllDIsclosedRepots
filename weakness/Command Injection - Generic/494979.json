For example trying to open a folder named `%TEST%` will result in the expansion of the environment variable, if it contains a `\"` then its possible to inject arbitrary commands after that `\"` in the directory name.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Create a new environment variable (or a temporary one), let's name it `TEST` and set its value: `\"`\n  2. Create a new folder named `%TEST%  \u0026\u0026 mkdir boom` and create a text file in it, let's name that file `test.txt`\n  3. Open `test.txt` with Notepad++ and click on `File-\u003eOpen Containing Folder-\u003ecmd`\n  4. The command in the folder name gets executed and the `boom` folder is created\n\n## Fix:\n\nEscape `%`characters before executing the command: `%` -\u003e `^%`.\n\n## Impact\n\nA successful attack can lead to arbitrary commands execution.","bounty_amount":"1363.7","formatted_bounty":"$1,363.70","weakness":{"id":58,"name":"Command Injection - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-06-06T00:46:56.108Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-74182736.37952757,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":50,"voters":["is-","w31rd0","base_64","insiderphd","qtros","an0nym0us","cr4xerbik4sh","codeanddecode","divyanshu29","tiago-danin","and 40 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4148700,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @underfl0wed, thanks for your submission.
