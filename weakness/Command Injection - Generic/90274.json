This is similar to a vulnerability recently found in zendesk.com as well. When a team member clicks export as csv and opens it instead of seeing =AND(2\u003e1) they see TRUE.  Meaning that cell is now active, and an attacker could make a chat request using a malicious function to execute malware on a team member's pc. \n\nSince functions aren't escaped, the possibilities of using this can be limitless and can cause a severe impact. One example is having it execute malware on staff's computer as seen below, leveraging cmd to execute commands. \n\n\nCrude Poc for executing cmd\nuse -2+3+cmd|' /C calc'!E1 and could execute malicious commands through CMD. \nE1 is the cell it's located in.\n\nAlthough excel has a feature to block this by tell a user that it wants to execute an external script, the team member would believe it's a trusted file coming from a trusted and have a high chance of this being executed. Seeing that it's generated by your site, they may believe it's an enhance functionalist of it to stream line, support. \n\nBest way to mitigate this vulnerability is if you append ' to the list of triggers, = , + , - Excel will ignore the ' and just show ='AND(2\u003e1) instead\n\nSources: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSV_Excel_Macro_Injection\n\n","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":58,"name":"Command Injection - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-12-05T02:03:59.117Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-184685795.84774947,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":5,"voters":["sw33tlie","alyssa_herrera","apapedulimu","luckydivino","spetr0x"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":597083,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"G2 would be used in the cmd poc since it's reflected there.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-09-24T05:23:10.377Z","updated_at":"2015-09-24T05:23:47.374Z","actor":{"username":"alyssa_herrera","cleared":true,"url":"/alyssa_herrera","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/PGiKyhRYWCkCp45rkdBZUAvL/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"zendesk","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":597715,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"Hello @psychomantis,\n\nCongratulations!
