However, when the web server is behind a reverse-proxy/WAF/Load-balancer/whatever, which is nowadays often the case, this variable will always return the IP address of the reverse-proxy/WAF/Load-balancer/whatever, failing to restrict the token to the client real IP address.\n\nIn order to restrict the token to the user real IP address, the Anti-CSRF Library should also check for the X-Forwared-For HTTP header.
