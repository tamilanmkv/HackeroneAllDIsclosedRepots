CSRF happens because browser appends all the cookies related to a domain when a request to a particular domain is being fired from the browser. As an attacker I can perform CSRF on post requests as well.\n\n**How**\n*I create an HTML file with a hidden form with all the parameters for the same request and form action. I will make place the button in such a place that the victim would be lured to click. \n*Once a valid user opens the same HTML file in a browser where he/she is logged in as and click the button, a request is fired. The browser is not aware if the user knowingly fired the request or not. It just knows that the request is to the domain and appends all the cookies automatically. \n*So it is pointless to implement the protection in cookies.  It should either be an HTTP header other than cookie or a POST parameter.\n\nLet me know if my understanding about the implementation is wrong anywhere.\n\nAlso for some mysterious reasons, when I click on save I am getting the same request which I showed in the screenshot.

Using your PoC gets me a 403, telling me the CSRF cookie is wrong. Why?\n- There is no header `X-CSRF-Token` present in the request. It's not possible to \"craft\" one, we would need to do an request *via* AJAX for this. Fortunately, it's not possible to do it, due to the [Same-domain policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy).\n- We can use an hidden field in the form, called `csrf_token`, since it's what the CSRF check permits. However, we'll have to make it match the value of the cookie `csrf_token`: there is no way to guess it without stealing the cookie of the user (which would require a XSS) or finding a bypass (we had a [creative use of a CRLF injection](https://github.com/gratipay/security-flh0cu/issues/1) to create a Cookie of an arbitrary value and submitting a `csrf_token` value matching).\n- Removing the header and not supplying a `csrf_token` will make the middleware try to match the value of the cookie with nothing, making it fail. \n\nThe idea behind using Cookies is that it's easy to [implement and get it working with forms and AJAX requests](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20504846/why-is-it-common-to-put-csrf-prevention-tokens-in-cookies) and that an attacked will never know the value inside, making him impossible to \"craft\" requests, since he'll always miss the right header / the right value to POST.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-17T09:18:48.392Z","updated_at":"2016-07-17T09:18:48.392Z","actor":{"username":"nashe_","cleared":false,"url":"/nashe_","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1072614,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"In addition, I suggest you to read [Django documentation about this subject](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/csrf/).","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-17T10:52:10.330Z","updated_at":"2016-07-17T10:52:10.330Z","actor":{"username":"nashe_","cleared":false,"url":"/nashe_","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1072720,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Wierdly enough, I realise that I have contributed this report to hackerone noise :D\nThe site wasn't loading properly yesterday and there was no X-CSRF header in the requests which made me doubt about CSRF.
