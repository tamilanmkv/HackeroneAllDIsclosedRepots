This works because the victim's browser happily sends the session cookie along with the forged POST request to the e-banking application. If the form would have been protected by a CSRF token, then the attacker could not have caused the victim's browser to send a valid POST request and thus the attack would not be possible.\n\nThis type of attack is called a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.\n\nIncidently, CSRF attacks are also the reason why people give the advice of never ever visiting other websites while being logged into an e-banking or other critical web application.\n\nCSRF tokens do not protect a web form being automatically submitted by regular authorized users as themselves. To protect from that, you'd use a CAPTCHA.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-23T11:33:23.048Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T11:33:23.048Z","actor":{"username":"anonymous_india","cleared":false,"url":"/anonymous_india","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uzbey","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":77688,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"You need to validate (on the server side) everything that needs to be validated. What exactly needs to be validated depends on many factors and personal choices. Some of it may be for safety, but only a bare minimum is needed for that in many cases. For the most part validation is to improve or create user experience.\n\nFor example you can check to see whether they have entered a valid email address. If they haven't, you can give them a message. If you don't do that nothing bad will happen to your application, but the user won't be able to receive email from you.\n\nThere is also an important distinction between validation and sanitation. Sanitation is done for security (e.g. to prevent injection). Validation is done to make sure that input meets requirements to work correctly with your application although incorrect input may be benign. It's also possible for sanitized malicious input to be valid.\n\nAll input must be sanitized. No input needs to be validated, so it's really up to you.\n\nCSRF protection has nothing to do with validation. All it does is prevent a user from making a request using your form from an external source because the only way to generate and see the token is to make a request to your site first.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-23T11:33:34.535Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T11:33:34.535Z","actor":{"username":"anonymous_india","cleared":false,"url":"/anonymous_india","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uzbey","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":77696,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNotApplicable","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-06-23T11:41:33.766Z","updated_at":"2014-06-23T11:41:33.766Z","actor":{"username":"prakharprasad","cleared":true,"url":"/prakharprasad","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/4Qcsaci6HdNLQCPM7oBdhJYY/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uzbey","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":77719,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Do
