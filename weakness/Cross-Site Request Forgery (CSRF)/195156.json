Login to your shopify account \n2. Create a private application then open the authentication example URL in a new browser.\n3. for testing , submit the following form through the browser in which you opened the example link: \n\n```\n\u003cform action=\"https://[shop].myshopify.com/admin/products.json\" method=post\u003e\n\u003cinput name=\"product[title]\" value=\"API CSRF TEST\"\u003e\n\u003cinput name=\"product[vendor]\" value=\"test\"\u003e\n\u003cinput name=\"product[body_html]\" value=\"\u003ch1\u003eAPI CSRF TEST [Can be stored XSS for admins]\u003c/h1\u003e\"\u003e\n \u003cinput name=\"product[product_type]\" value=\"test\"\u003e\n\u003cinput type=submit\u003e\n\u003c/form\u003e\n```\n4- Go to `[shop].myshopify.com/admin/products` and you'll see the product.\n\nAll the API endpoints are vulnerable , even the endpoints that only accept (PUT , PATCH or DELETE) , you can submit requests with these methods using `_method` parameter. \n#What is the problem here?\nThe vulnerability exists because API endpoints accept data submitted with `content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` without any validation for the authenticity token if the user is authenticated through HTTP authentication. \n#Impact:\nThrough this vulnerability an attacker can do malicious actions through the victim's session which includes: creating a webhook that pings the attacker's server for all events happening on the victim's shop, fulfilling orders  , creating a transaction ,editing themes ..etc (All possible actions done through the API).\n\n\nThanks and happy new year :)","bounty_amount":"1000.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,000","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":148606,"file_name":"example_api_url.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/148/606/0808aa3306f9065bcc9af872f5b46f0b475ea12d/example_api_url.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22example_api_url.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27example_api_url.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQRJF6VFL6%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T135906Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCID1So1KYRjOmBFJqLsqO1j9SSUCF9kJ%2FHqahOyDLmrnJAiAr2q5Z8bAgCyaCmyDSz7xwtmUTDOoz04myJOluBHRCeyqDBAju%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMvFUMWX6P00RsVarQKtcDflFFNScU3coA1YbnKy4lPXtwGDNsJcqhfcCTaePuAuK6nWvl5xRbjzjOBPvBHaTAnb2Iw%2B6Jdj2uyjmRMn%2F5%2F5AzD5di2wWOcC0am9iLaFmORG4VIVXTc8aAiiwqjNAu7dH2hTUNL9bwPzYUBq3%2FjwvNZUM%2FmpdXfugOwAP%2FP3w9e9PqozA16XzrwGIunimlg58HKZfOM0xp%2FESLFXRHAssX6DaYqQQyV5%2F0triAQeOx328GOBUjfGTiAl1aoS1J0%2FqN%2BmywXW%2FqqkEfAQ2n2f18dX2dkbwMnyQ4F47zR6jJw3CdBkeCPRDbbhcu8YGu2%2F%2BzzM9B4uguhR76M3KYB3dr919eRp%2F%2BcOfUxc8TC3gXMmp1jh0ywwC27sBrzUgZdh%2B2g4artPxRaRZPHbQvC%2F1OZ0MxZYsQmEItbUc65WqfO6PSdLbymEFDMyN5ona14j%2BaQHfp1MWNaO02I2WPYO5mZIsPuHjCO5MYUldcsrZMP7pydKVo87gkO2fPB2orxw1RGazxVwGy5R2PDIV7HsKH4KSOqhGLTTYcSjZvxzmTWIy013yrXhU3CEdFUoB7QifSN1bUli2cMIaUe7sr75onhlaNnQxqLv%2By7jqQ9RiOHvcMM4XIMInwkIsGOqYBzgDHFUI%2FtkToYUBHsGsXyI9vGkS81IUV4PSjgSfvCFIGR%2BPjro3EYi30Oc%2FQZijhik3H1oI82Vno5zo%2BVnueR7%2BkGCloKvMkJAe%2F77e%2BPPRDClquvRG9ERm7ELsd6WvljYOJTmuP4pWPW%2B2d%2BQu26lThNein0I5abJKiu%2FYvnXDmBeYAgLMwbyg9Lq3qT5qMKsr3i1aOgHcGHtYldnzNcLqwaNJYhw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=a90eb48b67509fd99b13584d0fff8134355df7d19f7c2b8a697e7c18109c6e5c","file_size":148208,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":26,"voters":["delimitry","drsniper","fqdn","flashdisk","aryan2808","mdv","rudra_2000","pappan","eveeez","th3g3nt3lman","and 16 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1459682,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report.
