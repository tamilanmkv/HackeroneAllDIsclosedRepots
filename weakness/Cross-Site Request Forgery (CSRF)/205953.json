Chain your internal redirect requests (shown in POC)\n2. Simply embed 1000x 1px image that with the target link (of course different product id per image)\n\nBecause of the extreme volume of the added items, the attacker can make the target's save list simply unusable (he must then delete 1000 entries and NO ONE will do that). I think a lot of people are taking advantage of the list, so a CSRF here can have a pretty big/annoying impact and you could loose clients.\n\nVideo POC attached.\n\n","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-09-28T07:22:49.215Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-127377600.51996337,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":15,"voters":["jensec","vijay_kumar","bugdiscloseguys","samet","eveeez","r3y","khizer47","justas_b","mr_r3boot","t4ym","and 5 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":4.3,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1487233,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-02-15T15:17:20.498Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T15:17:20.498Z","actor":{"username":"alexs","cleared":false,"url":"/alexs","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"lyst","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1524159,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-03-07T12:36:16.763Z","updated_at":"2017-03-07T12:36:16.763Z","actor":{"url":"/lyst","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/334/0915cf74d60a19ff359a42f4dfa3f9878957e589_original./fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Lyst"}},"bounty_amount":"150.0","bounty_currency":"usd","bonus_amount":"0.0","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"lyst","collaborator":{"username":"inhibitor181","url":"/inhibitor181"},"actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1574906,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @alexs @lyst \n\nI see that this has been fixed.
