This allows a malicious 3rd party application to gain full API access to a victim's Periscope account.\n\n#Details\nPeriscope has developer APIs that allow a 3rd party application to access resources on behalf of a user. The authorizion page is like this https://www.periscope.tv/oauth?client_id=█████████\u0026redirect_uri=https://getmevo.com/oauth/periscope\n\nIt was found that the authorize endpoint does not have any protection against CSRF. The request to authorize a 3rd party application to access one's Periscope account is as follows:\n```http\nPOST https://www.periscope.tv/oauthAuthorize HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.periscope.tv\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.87 Safari/537.36\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nCookie: sid=[...]\n\nclient_id=████\u0026redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fgetmevo.com%2Foauth%2Fperiscope?abc\n```\nAs one can see, there is no CSRF token or Origin validation.\n\nAfter a 3rd party application gets the *authorization code* from *redirect_uri*, it can then exchange it for an access token.\n\n#Impact\nSince the Developer APIs are not public, I have no information what the APIs can perform. Based on the the description on the authorization page however, it looks intimidating that it has **full access** to an account.\n{F170579}\nAt minimum, I found endpoints that allow creating a broadcast (https://public-api.periscope.tv/v1/broadcast/create), tweeting it (https://public-api.periscope.tv/v1/broadcast/publish) and deleting a broadcast (https://public-api.periscope.tv/v1/broadcast/delete).\n\n#PoC\n1. Make sure you are logged into Periscope Web (https://periscope.tv)\n2. Go to http://innerht.ml/pocs/periscope-oauth-csrf/\n3. You will be redirected to something like https://getmevo.com/oauth/periscope?code=abcde\u0026state=, copy the *code* value in the parameter\n4. Go to http://innerht.ml/pocs/periscope-oauth-csrf/code.php?code=abcde and replace the above code in the parameter\n5. A tweet will be posted in your timeline with a broadcast\n\nThe behind the scene is:\n1. Exchange *code* for *access_token* (https://public-api.periscope.tv/v1/oauth/token)\n2. Create a broadcast (https://public-api.periscope.tv/v1/broadcast/create)\n3. Publish it (https://public-api.periscope.tv/v1/broadcast/publish)\n\nNote that a real attack does not require user interaction. In this PoC the manual copying of *code* is because I don't have a 3rd party Periscope application. \n\n#Fix\nAdd CSRF protection","bounty_amount":"2520.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,520","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":170579,"file_name":"periscope-fullaccess.PNG","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/170/579/3e178eb084c267491a3e41fddee17c764739889e/periscope-fullaccess.PNG?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22periscope-fullaccess.PNG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27periscope-fullaccess.PNG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ2T6DG5UU%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T140516Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQCyGt%2F6wKTb7WdhbTEehok3geSSNypgF1jy9glhzjfqmQIhAN%2FZ96OUsxT3l%2FcNh%2BJaiqKBQp%2B0XefuAf%2BhfC%2FmhMZBKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgxZblqGtDqM2dUzvNgq1wMBRL4HwjcRdARKHRTYG1WTOwsUnNm5pyWIDl6UX7cxu3S9pxhLAGamITa%2Bry536DE0dNafGhdIyPeponbLp8FxjTVDEDmVrSlc3vq07ilX%2FsvaFMPbfLwUFwN8DcJVAZSLYZA6zDdeKNCgrZ1ISy%2BuSl%2F8sa9Nj%2FKFffdAxrEzWdcbmnUnTxt6PFvOqigHySvKHcRU1WUlzR%2BJNQhShWoYk3WMwt3lGEOyDeyEBa1PjWzXfwU5hwfOCygWSHeqe3rws%2Fy%2FAjcJ4Igs3dp7VWi2gpey9dMnBlv29eq43WYKyQ6K0q%2FC9l73EFZqlsoZAnNWCF%2BaMWp%2FSNCQCoi6LiyTT3H7xbPsVAE%2F%2B6%2B%2Fmd5o4HWlwOrPWTPapPHw%2BSF0OGtEIdy9BSNcjjpsTprmH3CxZWrOiVUBzDRDrImWT3QqtKWRETxE5UkMEesELPvS1Vr78fUKmIPG33W64ks49siCJg%2BYlvii52MslCAhwi8OBai4EvmsepnSL4Y7WjbGc31Zh7uWP1tOMXaSXgoK4ZXpbX9aNZgfinEq%2FEdjmz1acLqkVL8LTALuORrCaSQNzbL1VsrMHnDQY5Ip6UHG9W3WhTLOB2rMmAx%2FYtqF%2F2HrLRQRuA5lXPow%2F4aRiwY6pAFiuHIrJ99Gk48YedhIWLylCmpLudXTrjRTQ5%2BPJgz8sHy%2FJL%2BbYgchWh7RyeRvXCGWkecfBiAUWkHftxJlLxZP3R4oliu1hG1pnP80N0SBXLpKCFAQqqhncEnNPuXaqUaPMjKqpRRMw76WlTCCpu34SiacreJDZDO6dLymqMm3OX1OpD5Y13L2IbUTLcllZFway4EkA3FPk2PKaxAARwJYsWedpQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=da0eb9fba838c7b8aead1c152f6b94f8036026f0c61c3c618ab40af7703cb3c5","file_size":40126,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-08-19T16:00:28.960Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-130802687.77685034,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":61,"voters":["flamezzz","jensec","cdl","bl4de","spam404","flashdisk","thisishrsh","ngalog","0xsyndr0me","vijay_kumar","and 51 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1565880,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report.
