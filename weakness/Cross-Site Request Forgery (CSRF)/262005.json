applications, clients are required to submit forms which can perform sensitive operations.\n\nAn example of such a form being used would be when an administrator wishes to create a new user for the application.\n\nIn the simplest version of the form, the administrator would fill-in:\n\nName\nPassword\nRole (level of access)\nContinuing with this example, Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) would occur when the administrator is tricked into clicking on a link, which if logged into the application, would automatically submit the form without any further interaction.\n\nCyber-criminals will look for sites where sensitive functions are performed in this manner and then craft malicious requests that will be used against clients via a social engineering attack.\n\nThere are 3 things that are required for a CSRF attack to occur:\n\nThe form must perform some sort of sensitive action.\nThe victim (the administrator the example above) must have an active session.\nMost importantly, all parameter values must be known or guessable.\nArachni discovered that all parameters within the form were known or predictable and therefore the form could be vulnerable to CSRF.\n\nManual verification may be required to check whether the submission will then perform a sensitive action, such as reset a password, modify user profiles, post content on a forum, etc.\n\n(CWE)\nhttp://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html\n\nhttps://gratipay.com/apply","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-21T17:59:41.857Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T17:59:41.857Z","actor":{"username":"behzad900","cleared":false,"url":"/behzad900","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1944199,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::CommentsClosed","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-21T18:04:38.702Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T18:04:38.702Z","actor":{"url":"/gratipay","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/001/868/a75c6649c5b4671b3cf44160af884a7da9fd0b67_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Gratipay"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1944200,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ManuallyDisclosed","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-21T18:04:46.041Z","updated_at":"2017-08-21T18:04:46.041Z","actor":{"username":"edio","cleared":false,"url":"/edio","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/193/501/c186a057285438756d4c4d27cbf3b8965cf1f51b_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1944203,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Automated
