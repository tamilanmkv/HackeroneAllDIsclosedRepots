@bugbound,\n\n\u003eI could provide a patch via github if needed?\n\nYes, please do.\n\nWe've decided that this issue is a low-grade/low-impact issue and is qualified as a LOW severity vulnerability as described in our [Vulnerability Response Process](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/blob/master/VULNERABILITY_RESPONSE_PROCESS.md). As such, instead of proceeding with point 8 and 9 in section III, we ask that you PR the patch directly to github.\n\nA proven vulnerability also gives you the option to receive bounty. Do you wish to receive XMR bounty? Is so, please paste an XMR address here into this report. You can generate a temporary address or an address dedicated solely to this bug report if you'd like.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-02-15T08:50:13.534Z","updated_at":"2018-02-15T08:50:13.534Z","actor":{"username":"anonimal","cleared":false,"url":"/anonimal","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/040/857/f23cc3be09a21e17bc43975987c10ba2b6427239_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"monero","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2385877,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Great
