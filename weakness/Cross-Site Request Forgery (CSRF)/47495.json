Bypass is simple here - we can use username@hostname notation - http://.mail.ru@lab.ropchain.org/r.php?r=HTTPS://ANY-OTHER-URL.COM ;-) (r.php returns 301 and redirects us where $_GET['r'] tells). \r\n\r\nTo make this attack even simpler - ajaxCall() function have js_callback parameter, where we can handle our Cross-Origin response, and parse it. \r\n\r\nSo the example attack scenario goes like this:\r\n1. Attacker create specially crafted webpage where he embeds uploader9.swf\r\n2. Because of Security.allowDomain('*') we can interact with this file from any domain, so it works. \r\n3. Because ajax() callback we can send requests to any other webpage.\r\n4. Because of crossdomain.xml of mail.ru we can gain full response from mail.ru and pass it to our js_callback (that \"works\" for attacker's origin).\r\n\r\nIn this scenario I'll call https://mail.ru/?json=1\u0026nano=0 that returns sort of informations about logged in user in JSON format. To watch exploit in action - visit this page: https://eip.uid0.pl/mail.php (it requires SSL, sorry for self-signed cert).\r\n\r\nVideo demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIUlSJ-Wvgk (unlisted one - only me and you have this link)\r\n\r\nThanks for reading it - have a nice day!\r\nJakub Zoczek","bounty_amount":"600.0","formatted_bounty":"$600","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-03-27T14:29:01.124Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-206498091.4335497,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["sw33tlie","fantam1","spetr0x","bc4b5f39ded739ad062bffc"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":330951,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for reporting your bug to Mail.Ru Group!

You'd probably need some additional informations about technique I used here (details are in initial report, but few changes was made).\n\nSo... using initial report technique I'm able to make cross-origin requests and gain responses. The main problem was that your HTML content have escaped 0x22 (apostrophe) char. When the content was sent to javascript callback - only 0x22 chars are escaped by flash, but as far as it was escaped before - the double escape happened and we had \\\\\" chars that broke syntax and I was unable to get the e.mail.ru html content. I worked hard all day to make some trick and ES6 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) supported for example in latest Firefox. In ES6 - we don't need to use 0x22 or 0x27 chars to construct strings - we can use backticks. ;) So the new, full attack scenario to read user's emails is:\n\n1.  We use initial Proof of Concept to get user's email (your API needs it). [index.php]\n2. After gaining e-mail - we pass it to gettoken.php as GET parameter.\n3. We're calling https://e.mail.ru/password/restore/?login=zuezuozuezuo`;//hehe and using gogo` as callback [gettoken.php]\n4. The flash will construct this kind of function call:\n\ngogo`\u003chtml\u003ecotent with escaped apostrophes \\\" and double-escaped apostrophes \\\\\" and it won't break snytax (...) zuezuozuezuo`;//hehe rest of html content\u003c/html\u003e)}catch(e)(...)\n\nUsing this trick we will gain part of html content - but we are able to extract API token from there. \n\n5. After parsing output and gaining token - we pass it (with login stolen before) to getthreads.php\n6. We have API token , user's email and we are able to gain JSON content from https://e.mail.ru/api/v1/threads/status method\n7. We're parsing JSON, get list of thread's subjects and thread ids. \n8. Using any thread ID we are able to pass it to getemail.php\n9. We are making request to https://e.mail.ru/cgi-bin/getmsg  and gaining e-mail content.\n10.
