Sign into New Relic app as admin.\n2. Open an attached html file {F435288} in the same browser and wait iframe to be fully loaded.\n3. Navigate to roles page (`https://account.newrelic.com/accounts/\u003caccount_id\u003e/roles`) and make sure there is a new custom role \"CSRF_ROLE\".\n{F435275}\n\n**Mitigation**\nThis endpoint implements some CSRF-protection: it checks the referer and origin headers, but these checks can be bypassed using the form (doesn't send Origin header) and data: URI (form inside data: URI doesn't send Referer header).

@skavans,\n\nThank you for your report! We've received similar reports in the past, but it's our feeling that if exploitation requires a user to download, execute, and interact with a file, then it's kind of game over for that user (why not replace that file with a keylogger, for example?).\n\nWe've adopted a CORS-based approach to CSRF protection, as opposed to a token-based approach, as it allows us to bake in CSRF protections for all applications at the service mesh tier, even those that communicate cross-domain (and cross-language/platform) without having to rebuild CSRF token logic each time. To us, these benefits would seem to outweigh the very low likelihood of a local file being used to forge an authenticated web request.\n\nWe appreciate you taking the time to write this up, and are definitely willing to revisit this topic if you can think of ways that this is more likely to be exploited! I also see that you have another report filed with us, and will take a look at that later today.\n\nCheers,\nAlex","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-03-04T18:40:10.068Z","updated_at":"2019-03-04T18:40:10.068Z","actor":{"username":"ahamlin","cleared":false,"url":"/ahamlin","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/037/071/b10c1e5872fac616ba0f3b67bb1e6e06ba70fe6c_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"newrelic","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4255103,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @ahamlin,\n\nI am sorry for the unclear reproduce steps, it is my imperfection.\nVictim does not need to download something, this HTML-payload can be placed at any webserver, so it is only needed to visit malicious page to fire CSRF payload.\n\nPlease follow this correct reproduction steps:\n1.
