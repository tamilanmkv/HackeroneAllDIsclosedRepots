Whenever a user will login then after login users will be suddenly automatically logged out of their account.\n\nVictims will not have to visit any other malicious website containg the above html code because attacker can use https://teamname.slack.com/files/create/post to embed the above url which is being used to logout users.\n\n**Steps to Verify:**\n1. Login to your slack team and navigate to https://teamname.slack.com/files/create/post.\n2. Give any title to the post.\n3. Input ![image title](https://teamname.slack.com/reset/youareloggedout) and save \u0026 publish the post.\n4. Now login from another account and click on the post above created. Opening this post will log you out of your account.\n\nNow whenever you login to that account after loged in you will be imediately logged out of your account as the malicious post will be remain open in the Flexpane and will trigger the logout. And actually now you will never be able to login to that account.\n\nI thinks now its not only a simple Logout issue but now its becomes more severe as attacker can restrict all the other users of same team to able to login to their account for forever.\n\nAnd kindly fix this soon because now I am not able to login to my own account.\n\nThanks\n**Uttam Soren**","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-04-04T09:49:45.368Z","updated_at":"2015-04-04T10:02:27.562Z","actor":{"username":"oldusername","cleared":false,"url":"/oldusername","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":372425,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Thanks for the detailed report - a fix for this issue has now been released.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-04-04T21:12:03.686Z","updated_at":"2015-04-04T21:12:03.686Z","actor":{"username":"iamcal","cleared":false,"url":"/iamcal","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/138/0e164dd6477c48d57f2f5a1c56756f7ec98229cf_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"oldusername","url":"/oldusername"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":372426,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-04-04T21:12:11.031Z","updated_at":"2015-04-04T21:12:11.031Z","actor":{"url":"/slack","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/069/683fee312381bc46cadc7ea1950abc87944d12c3_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Slack"}},"bounty_amount":"100.0","bounty_currency":"usd","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","collaborator":{"username":"oldusername","url":"/oldusername"},"actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":372516,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-04-05T05:59:44.546Z","updated_at":"2015-04-05T05:59:44.546Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"oldusername","cleared":false,"url":"/oldusername","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":401930,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-05-05T05:59:54.732Z","updated_at":"2015-05-05T05:59:54.732Z","actor":{"url":"/slack","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/069/683fee312381bc46cadc7ea1950abc87944d12c3_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Slack"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
