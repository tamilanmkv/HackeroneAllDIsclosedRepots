The`per_form_csrf_token` is generated using a HMAC SHA-256 using a key that is exposed in a reversed `authenticity_token`. The `authenticity_token` is a Base64 encoding of\n\n`one_time_pad | (one_time_pad XOR session[:csrf_token])`\n\nBecause the `one_time_pad` is the first half of the `authenticity_token`, it is not secret and an attacker can reverse the token to learn `session[:csrf_token]`.\n\nFrom there the attacker can forge a hash for an arbitrary route (e.g. /articles/2):\n`HMAC ( session[:csrf_token], \"/articles/2#patch\")`\n\nTo reproduce:\n1. Have two Rails routes that accept only per form csrf tokens\n2. Validate that the `authenticity_token` sent in the POST data returns an HTTP 422 when sent in the other form\n3. Forge a per form token with the attached exploit script\n   - the `authenticity_token` parameter is taken from the \u003cmeta\u003e tag in the header of any page for the session\n   - the `route` parameter is the action of the target HTML form (e.g /articles/2)\n   - the `method` parameter is the value from `_method` parameter sent in the POST data (e.g. patch)\n4. Take the forged token from the exploit script, URL-encode it, and send it as the `authenticity_token` in the POST data. For reliability, ensure that:\n   -  the route parameter matches the endpoint,\n   - the `_method` parameter in the POST data matches what used for `method` in the exploit script\n   - the forged `authenticity_token` in the POST data is properly URL-encoded\n\n## Impact\n\nExploitation allow an attacker to forge valid per-form CSRF tokens even in hardened situations where the global `authenticity_token` itself is not allowed.\n\nFor the attack to be successful, an attacker would need a valid global `authenticity_token`. This can be extracted out of a web page without any protections that cookies have (such as HTTP-Only). An attacker could leverage an XSS vulnerability to bypass per-form CSRF on unrelated pages. Because the token can be forged for any form, code execution on a page without forms could still lead to attackers bypassing CSRF protections of forms related to password changes, deletion of data, creation of new users, etc.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":629421,"file_name":"perform_csrftoken_forgery.py","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/SgetMcZgZhZF1JVrLGfTPudN?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22perform_csrftoken_forgery.py%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27perform_csrftoken_forgery.py\u0026response-content-type=text%2Fx-python-script\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQX46P3UGI%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T152122Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIGvlFSN4tPhAu4V7v5pc7%2F6eSiik7IhHLLD01kiqhVWYAiB5Dz9ea%2BLZD%2BpLtagj4O%2BjrW%2FPBVXyOw%2FvfPhYOWnLJyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMy2N4EHiSo%2FA9G2F0KtcDeo3CuylmH%2BuFka3rGPAArFX7PEojyq8EAAWPijF4XtZGXNXpmeQR1pzTOcI0Rm%2Fvja%2BwHd%2F8TxJsGVWeh%2Flk5vjiIRZT9GPW9u3ZycCrjqMci9iGhBM6uwkYQOmABA3poTj0CyTV9vU5PwMEPHFcEacwKutRiCveofJe7f8Tu4WHR%2BNU7KEmxqtXpvAXj8hQLxFVDU25WgaPgk2b4mSQSaY%2FPywLP4TuBkCMbSNVoBG2JTX5CaBeJN5iElkzZ62K%2FGVGXrbaaNyPhn%2BB8rXIjbw78eQJEkHjvT8OqfCHAYP5f%2B4IhYfTll35nE7LIUoMiLvBq6tkN5BWqoopu%2Fpju60lSqB656qlcZeAK9f5orDqJzDwlKMnoVzqvkUrUy9bmk%2BkxGW97VVmeHZ1t0v3wof%2BrT0QSrWeBO35JesCQ%2BdFE8O%2BxosSdP7tU4A%2BDPpxwomZQHAAcNR9Aywt%2FQ8Qbv894mkGzt9WDwY%2FFN8jeU3O6C%2BmyqjrgMf7nGycFeD87%2Bsgs8CikLj6%2BhBYFpskae2EppYXvqHFDwWaJKFLdI8X3NNsrRpCnIXL5GUe8p%2BBySjVvE4SnyaxoJD5sUMGcJj0QQyQGgO22eUI1ATV1DsO%2BN%2BaLLxtMPqIkYsGOqYBTa91vvmG%2BK28LWqLSYG8vhMxYQ%2Fxj6PD70iq5MyM9pLPu1bgCyqJfX2mwm9fHA6UDqgGoerI%2Bnp3Q6V4OYY0E3hEAx7T8Q%2FppO8G%2BTgH7gaNlLC%2Fng4%2BkFoIuXyVGb7q1PCueRn4pqAqwTocflxXYcQQGudKiKkzrNHGy4UeULO76lDgSIcMEtI1vIJ76b2MxFEJwq4lWhln09Xn3ksb8maUXRDeCg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=9a6f49776212111d5a3bf7f1bd76d39de5e2752bb85d47f4178771ec326566a7","file_size":2199,"type":"text/x-python-script"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-08-27T16:25:48.083Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-35420133.94022946,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":6,"voters":["yxw21","n0x496n","dmc3","meispi","iamn00b007","n3tra"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":5.9,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"high","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":160,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/rails/rails","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6270965,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @jregele \n\nThank you for your submission.

Please forgive me if they are overly detailed in case you are familiar with Burp Suite, but it may be the quickest way to actually demonstrate the vulnerability. I built a sample Rails app using the tutorial found here \n\nhttps://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html\n\nUnzip the attached archive which includes all the source code. From the root directory of the app, you will need to run\n`rails db:migrate`\n\nI also made a quick and dirty edit in request_forgery_protection.rb and set\n`self.per_form_csrf_tokens = true`\nThis edit is in the Rails code itself. I'm sure there is a way to configure the application but this worked for the PoC. If this isn't set then the per-form CSRF tokens won't be checked at all.\n\nFrom there, here are detailed instructions\n1. Run `rails serve` and navigate to http://0.0.0.0:3000/articles/new\n2. View the page source \n3. Copy the csrf-token from the \u003cmeta\u003e tag at the top of the page\ni.e. `\u003cmeta name=\"csrf-token\" content=\"BxSRVq2osX+j+78Orj9AUQGThHexC1WBf8/jGFVWbOp9lpIYN+oDZATSceHWGpIhkyG6Du+eHMfqOLm9IM+hFA==\" /\u003e`\n4. Create 2 articles. Title and text can be anything, but it is useful for them to be distinct (i.e. asdf/asdf and qwer/qwer)\n5. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3000/articles/ and see the articles that have been created.\n6. Use Burp Suite as an intercepting proxy (there is a free community edition). Intercepting traffic on localhost can be problematic, but loading the application at 0.0.0.0:3000 will work. (optional: Under Target -\u003e Scope, under \"Include in scope\", click \"Add\" and enter http://0.0.0.0:3000/. Then Proxy -\u003e Options -\u003e Intercept Client Requests, make sure \"Intercept requests based on the following rules\" is checked. Then make sure that the \"is in target scope\" rule is enabled. This will filter out all other requests from the proxy.)\n7. Make sure proxy inteception is working based on your OS and Browser. Under Proxy -\u003e Intercept, make sure the \"Intercept is on\" button is pressed. Load http://0.0.0.0:3000/articles/ in the browser. The request should be intercepted by Burp suite\n8. Disable interception in Burp\n9. click 'edit' for one of the articles. \n10. Enable interception in Burp\n11. On the web page, click 'Update Article'. The POST request will appear in the intercept window in Burp\n12. In Burp proxy, right click the intercepted request and select \"Send to Repeater\"\n13. Go the the repeater tab and see something like:\n\n`POST /articles/1 HTTP/1.1\nHost: 0.0.0.0:3000\nContent-Length: 210\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nOrigin: http://0.0.0.0:3000\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/78.0.3904.70 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3\nReferer: http://0.0.0.0:3000/articles/1/edit\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9\nCookie: csrftoken=9tlkrMsUDODKWNM9Qq3kbv6Pd84tHDu7mUIAWVwQExhwiD1guG55U38DfrkINYVg; _blog_session=Qe%2FKflKKyab%2BJysm56C5YkRBtuwqRkdJNtwtxyY6FM4llpNxDru%2BijMX1hdSJwzRUMDRHvo2Wa5uWpWFHZpkChbgqB9zuiFoNegHSRrwZP1PW5p7fKWgUFBBfSfqrtcdRVSMrN48FBDRHa2TqQ6OYwBzuKbyWjsCbn%2BoG45hFdBfCwmzPbmg%2Bx5nqaWO6%2B7Gmv3002gueqhwxlPaB7xbCvpnPMItQmEX%2BNygnxU2RXenVHDSSvAmxlAR8haUSQW0RWwV7%2F47ZVhARZyICbd8RfUNzuGW--hZ9kG6mEU8XQZEIw--HmlncMiDDC7XsQQCyKHASw%3D%3D\nConnection: close\n\n_method=patch\u0026authenticity_token=uNPIL0xLS%2BQuvXsY%2FoPYxujT%2FLZdWOvME%2FNJkYYFx3aLL1l6AJuIUMBFGlH7vio7x2u0W%2FbrrVcCbLsxV%2FGlSw%3D%3D\u0026article%5Btitle%5D=zxcv\u0026article%5Btext%5D=zxcvzxcv\u0026commit=Update+Article`\n\n14. Click Send.\n15. The response pane should show an HTTP/1.1 302 Found in the top line. The bottom of the request will read:\n`\u003chtml\u003e\u003cbody\u003eYou are being \u003ca href=\"http://0.0.0.0:3000/articles/1\"\u003eredirected\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e`\nThis is what a successful form post looks like.\n\n16. Change the top line of the request to `POST /articles/2`, where the 2 here is a different number than the articles/1 in the previous request. If per-form CSRF tokens are enabled, the server will respond with a 422 message and an error page. If the server does not return a 422, per-form-csrf-tokens are not enabled. See my note about editing request_forgery_protection.rb. If that file has been successfully edited, restart the rails server.\n\n17. Run the exploit to forge an `authenticity_token` for the request. Usage of the exploit script is as follows:\n`python perform_csrftoken_forgery.py \u003ccsrf-token from step 3\u003e \u003croute\u003e \u003cmethod\u003e`\nThis requires the csrf-token gathered in step 3. If the request that failed was `/articles/2`, use \"articles/2\" for the route. The method here is \"patch\" (no quotes). So if we are forging a token to edit /articles/2, we would run the exploit as follows\n`python perform_csrftoken_forgery.py \u003ccsrf-token from step 3\u003e \"articles/2\" patch`\n\n\n18. Copy the output token and in Burpsuite go to the Decoder tab. Paste the forged token into the pane, and then click \"Encode as ...\" and select URL.\n\n19. Copy the URL encoded string and go back to the Repeater tab. \n20. Replace the value of the authenticity_token with the URL encoded forged token. You can also change the title or article values, but make sure not to change any of the %5D or %5B characters. Click send\n21. The form will be accepted and the server will respond with a 302 response like it did in the first request. This means the forged token was accepted as valid.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-12T21:59:06.064Z","updated_at":"2019-11-12T21:59:06.064Z","actor":{"username":"jregele","cleared":false,"url":"/jregele","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"attachments":[{"id":632807,"filename":"blog.zip","type":"application/zip","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/obekYAEuJr4DWc7YiKJESzjV?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22blog.zip%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27blog.zip\u0026response-content-type=application%2Fzip\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQX46P3UGI%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T152122Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIGvlFSN4tPhAu4V7v5pc7%2F6eSiik7IhHLLD01kiqhVWYAiB5Dz9ea%2BLZD%2BpLtagj4O%2BjrW%2FPBVXyOw%2FvfPhYOWnLJyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMy2N4EHiSo%2FA9G2F0KtcDeo3CuylmH%2BuFka3rGPAArFX7PEojyq8EAAWPijF4XtZGXNXpmeQR1pzTOcI0Rm%2Fvja%2BwHd%2F8TxJsGVWeh%2Flk5vjiIRZT9GPW9u3ZycCrjqMci9iGhBM6uwkYQOmABA3poTj0CyTV9vU5PwMEPHFcEacwKutRiCveofJe7f8Tu4WHR%2BNU7KEmxqtXpvAXj8hQLxFVDU25WgaPgk2b4mSQSaY%2FPywLP4TuBkCMbSNVoBG2JTX5CaBeJN5iElkzZ62K%2FGVGXrbaaNyPhn%2BB8rXIjbw78eQJEkHjvT8OqfCHAYP5f%2B4IhYfTll35nE7LIUoMiLvBq6tkN5BWqoopu%2Fpju60lSqB656qlcZeAK9f5orDqJzDwlKMnoVzqvkUrUy9bmk%2BkxGW97VVmeHZ1t0v3wof%2BrT0QSrWeBO35JesCQ%2BdFE8O%2BxosSdP7tU4A%2BDPpxwomZQHAAcNR9Aywt%2FQ8Qbv894mkGzt9WDwY%2FFN8jeU3O6C%2BmyqjrgMf7nGycFeD87%2Bsgs8CikLj6%2BhBYFpskae2EppYXvqHFDwWaJKFLdI8X3NNsrRpCnIXL5GUe8p%2BBySjVvE4SnyaxoJD5sUMGcJj0QQyQGgO22eUI1ATV1DsO%2BN%2BaLLxtMPqIkYsGOqYBTa91vvmG%2BK28LWqLSYG8vhMxYQ%2Fxj6PD70iq5MyM9pLPu1bgCyqJfX2mwm9fHA6UDqgGoerI%2Bnp3Q6V4OYY0E3hEAx7T8Q%2FppO8G%2BTgH7gaNlLC%2Fng4%2BkFoIuXyVGb7q1PCueRn4pqAqwTocflxXYcQQGudKiKkzrNHGy4UeULO76lDgSIcMEtI1vIJ76b2MxFEJwq4lWhln09Xn3ksb8maUXRDeCg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=f901dddce3a9b955aa9de655083d4f064e0d4730ec813f45fda55ce08cbc0e6a"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6292359,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Also, I wanted to add that the pentest where I discovered this, I found the client is passing authenticity_tokens and csrf-tokens around in URLs.

There are 2 things.\n1. the route needs to have a slash in the beginning, so `/articles/2` instead of `articles/2`. I stepped through the code in a debugger to make sure.\n2. The token that needs to be fed to the python script needs to come from the \u003cmeta\u003e tag with the name `csrf-token` at the top of the page source. It isn't URL encoded, which is why I never had to URL decode before using the script. I think you were pulling the token from the form submission request. Once per-form tokens are enabled, the `authenticity_token` in the form will already be hashed. So what the python script does it reverse the `csrf-token` in the \u003cmeta\u003e tag to get the internal token, and then hashes it with the new route.\n\nI'm going to make a video of it tomorrow to show the steps because jet lag is killing me at the moment.\n\nBest,\nJustin","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-22T04:53:56.841Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T04:53:56.841Z","actor":{"username":"jregele","cleared":false,"url":"/jregele","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6377037,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-22T09:43:21.690Z","updated_at":"2019-11-22T09:43:21.690Z","actor":{"username":"ktistai","cleared":false,"url":"/ktistai","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/322/520/01cd21dce301646646276fd9125cffd448fbffd6_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6386692,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Attached is the demo video","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-11-23T17:25:59.338Z","updated_at":"2019-11-23T17:25:59.338Z","actor":{"username":"jregele","cleared":false,"url":"/jregele","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"attachments":[{"id":642052,"filename":"demo.zip","type":"application/zip","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/A7ZArJbqg7UVP7oAHb22NeTP?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22demo.zip%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27demo.zip\u0026response-content-type=application%2Fzip\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQX46P3UGI%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T152122Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIGvlFSN4tPhAu4V7v5pc7%2F6eSiik7IhHLLD01kiqhVWYAiB5Dz9ea%2BLZD%2BpLtagj4O%2BjrW%2FPBVXyOw%2FvfPhYOWnLJyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMy2N4EHiSo%2FA9G2F0KtcDeo3CuylmH%2BuFka3rGPAArFX7PEojyq8EAAWPijF4XtZGXNXpmeQR1pzTOcI0Rm%2Fvja%2BwHd%2F8TxJsGVWeh%2Flk5vjiIRZT9GPW9u3ZycCrjqMci9iGhBM6uwkYQOmABA3poTj0CyTV9vU5PwMEPHFcEacwKutRiCveofJe7f8Tu4WHR%2BNU7KEmxqtXpvAXj8hQLxFVDU25WgaPgk2b4mSQSaY%2FPywLP4TuBkCMbSNVoBG2JTX5CaBeJN5iElkzZ62K%2FGVGXrbaaNyPhn%2BB8rXIjbw78eQJEkHjvT8OqfCHAYP5f%2B4IhYfTll35nE7LIUoMiLvBq6tkN5BWqoopu%2Fpju60lSqB656qlcZeAK9f5orDqJzDwlKMnoVzqvkUrUy9bmk%2BkxGW97VVmeHZ1t0v3wof%2BrT0QSrWeBO35JesCQ%2BdFE8O%2BxosSdP7tU4A%2BDPpxwomZQHAAcNR9Aywt%2FQ8Qbv894mkGzt9WDwY%2FFN8jeU3O6C%2BmyqjrgMf7nGycFeD87%2Bsgs8CikLj6%2BhBYFpskae2EppYXvqHFDwWaJKFLdI8X3NNsrRpCnIXL5GUe8p%2BBySjVvE4SnyaxoJD5sUMGcJj0QQyQGgO22eUI1ATV1DsO%2BN%2BaLLxtMPqIkYsGOqYBTa91vvmG%2BK28LWqLSYG8vhMxYQ%2Fxj6PD70iq5MyM9pLPu1bgCyqJfX2mwm9fHA6UDqgGoerI%2Bnp3Q6V4OYY0E3hEAx7T8Q%2FppO8G%2BTgH7gaNlLC%2Fng4%2BkFoIuXyVGb7q1PCueRn4pqAqwTocflxXYcQQGudKiKkzrNHGy4UeULO76lDgSIcMEtI1vIJ76b2MxFEJwq4lWhln09Xn3ksb8maUXRDeCg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=dd2647a652834c6c9a2b0f1744a06bb3e6abeded9ca638365ef9c6473dddd1a8"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"rails","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6392592,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hello @jregele \n\nThank you for your submission!
