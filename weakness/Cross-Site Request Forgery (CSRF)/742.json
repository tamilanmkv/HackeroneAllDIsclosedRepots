The CSRF protection for Rails works by calling `reset_session` if validation fails. For logged-out users, this has no effect, as you'd expect. This is a reasonable system as exploiting CSRF against logged-out users does not present any security risks in almost all contexts. Unless there's some specific security implication that we've overlooked, we're going to treat the lack of CSRF enforcement when there's no active session as intentional and not a bug.
