Attacker can exploit it with more advanced techniques and can really lead to critical issues.\n1. Navigate to Project Settings -\u003e Modify any data and intercept the request, send it to repeater, and do the following.\n2. Take the HTML code format from burp suite -\u003e Engagement Tools -\u003e Generate CSRF POC.\n3. Put the piece of code in an html file, then open it.\n4. Now hit on the button and intercept its request.\n5. Change POST to PATCH.\n6. Copy the patch data from the old intercepted request from repeater and paste it to the current intercepted request and modify the data (email for example).\n7. Modify the request header of Content-Type: `Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8`\n8. Forward the request and CSRF exploited successfully and the modified data changed successfully  :)\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\nPlease See this video where I recorded the above PoC in details\n██████\n\n## Impact\n\nThis attack can be exploited in advanced way to modify all project settings and manipulate its data. Smart attacker can gain a big advantage from this bug. Hope you fix it asap.\n\n**Regards**","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":11,"voters":["sheikhrishad0","realtess","updatelap","what_web","dastan_9408","zimmer75","silv3rpoision","bb00x","cryptographer","iftek","and 1 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":38702,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"my.stripo.email","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6673784,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for the report \n\nI have created tasks for the developers to fix this asap.
