This lead to CSRF attack.\n\n**Bypassing Content-Type**\nThe application is just accepting Content-Type as application/json.\nThis can be bypassed in several ways.\nOne of the ways is to Forge Content-Type header with flash. You need a flash file capable of sending cross-domain requests and a 307 redirector page.\nFor more info please see: https://blog.cm2.pw/forging-content-type-header-with-flash/\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. Edit your company info and intercept its request.\n2. Get the HTML code format from burp suite -\u003e Engagement Tools -\u003e Generate CSRF POC.\n3. Click Test in Browser button, and on another browser/tab accessed by the victim account, paste the link.\n4. Now hit on the button and intercept its request.\n5. Modify the request header of Content-Type to: application/json.\n6. Forward the request and CSRF exploited successfully and the info changed successfully.\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nAdd a csrf-token in the header or in an hidden input to check if the user that is doing this action authorized or not.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis action is critical and sensitive. Attacker can upload this file to a url. Sends it to the victims. And when the authenticated victims navigate to the url their profile info will be modified.\n\n**Regards.**","weakness":{"id":45,"name":"Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":10,"voters":["sheikhrishad0","brahim_boufakri01","updatelap","dastan_9408","silv3rpoision","royal_coder","nasst","rrivera","maharjansharat","mdh"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":7764456,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
