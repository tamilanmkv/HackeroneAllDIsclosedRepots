Install the [Keybase Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keybase/ognfafcpbkogffpmmdglhbjboeojlefj)\n2. Navigate to the following URL address: `https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jupenur\u0026id=%22%3E%3Ciframe%20src%3D%22javascript:alert(document.domain)%22`\n3. Click on the **Keybase Chat** button\n4. You should see a JavaScript `alert` dialog with the domain name of the affected social networking site (`news.ycombinator.com`) in it\n\nThis example targets an HN profile page, but it should be equally possible to trigger the same vulnerability on any other supported website. The websites potentially affected are\n\n* reddit.com\n* twitter.com\n* facebook.com\n* github.com\n* news.ycombinator.com\n* keybase.io\n* keybase.pub\n\nIt may also be possible to exploit the vulnerability without requiring the user to click a button.\n\n## Suggested fix\n\nThe vulnerable code exploited in the example above is in the file `content.js`\n\n```JavaScript\n// Render the Keybase chat reply widget\nfunction renderChat(parent, user, nudgeSupported, closeCallback) {\n  const oobNudgeHTML = `\n      \u003cp\u003e\n        You will need to let \u003ca target=\"_blank\" href=\"${user.href()}\" class=\"external-user\"\u003e${user.display()}\u003c/a\u003e know that they have a Keybase message waiting for them.\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n      \u003cp\u003e\n        Share this handy link: \u003cspan class=\"keybase-copy\"\u003ehttps://keybase.io/docs/extension\u003c/span\u003e\n      \u003c/p\u003e\n  `;\n```\n\nThe functions `user.href()` and `user.display()` return strings parsed from the URL. These values are used directly in HTML markup (via `innerHTML`) at multiple points in the code.\n\n**It is recommended to avoid the use of `innerHTML` entirely.** Standard DOM methods like `createElement` should be used instead. The code also contains a function, `safeHTML`, which could be used to escape all untrusted input, but this is much more error prone.\n","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":63,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - DOM"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-07-26T15:46:44.380Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-132877450.19398749,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":22,"voters":["tk0","inhibitor181","bl4de","danila","ras-it","spam404","gamliel","xyodh","eveeez","r3y","and 12 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":6.1,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1705576,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the great report.
