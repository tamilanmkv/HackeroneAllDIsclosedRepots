When a web page is rendered, the framework will scan the page for template expressions, and execute any that it encounters. An attacker can exploit this by supplying a malicious template expression that launches a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nIf possible, avoid using server-side code to dynamically embed user input into client-side templates. You can prevent angular from executing expressions in blocks of HTML by using the ng-non-bindable directive: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngNonBindable If this is not practical, consider filtering out { and } from user input. Upgrading to Angular 1.5 will prevent this particular sandbox escape from working, but is not a robust fix as Angular maintain that the sandbox isn't a security feature and can't be trusted - see https://sites.google.com/site/bughunteruniversity/nonvuln/angularjs-expression-sandbox-bypass\n\nPlease refer to http://blog.portswigger.net/2016/01/xss-without-html-client-side-template.html for further information on this technique.","bounty_amount":"50.0","formatted_bounty":"$50","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":74379,"file_name":"zendesk_storedxss.PNG","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/074/379/d78b87a3f12340178e9a65d68f62ac8ad966aa94/zendesk_storedxss.PNG?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22zendesk_storedxss.PNG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27zendesk_storedxss.PNG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQWRDWPEXO%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T132952Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQDdpfP9zaQzdootuAesQcyxQfGfhPxZKuX1i7ijKLAzlAIgL5my807PEusr0VkqeU29XvZtEmCSLbM%2F7eKmnAELK9MqgwQI7v%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDLFQh%2Fbvd7dUg1KFQyrXA%2Fp%2FVtjehJVp7DZYy5u7sRWqZAssugTjxjLMX9n3LuBamcp6G%2Bwyw1kdH5Fc0oMbmVnKCYku75m349ci99IeZGYssnHPQFOGi3KPZcYmBTpCSWJYXklFmUzTDVSnxhcahSThqLhsURXVfnsh6wXSKZz6MsS7fD7HYiuK725Q%2F6sDk7h3pCuB5fUOqyZvOi6e%2FdSM5nyuKqUFkte%2F6i0uholiPHuOhv3puwk%2FK6F%2FiNA6QbCLyZcsFIj5wNcphNxGCbAX8GNv59qxPkBv7zU5QMZhaSRKnyFLoxSNWLKFqeO4qdN%2FgRbEF2RLvY5V1AD1BbElezpO2DYcV6sIiHwCYBPAVtJWc0Oep1T8Sx%2FIWEFxpRS%2B4EQR6%2BcQhrIR2caxSjEaPr13FV3IBlGYyL4TqPiwhW8W9gb3y9c3v7PIUkqs8IYIlAbA%2BK0arNEJfKBmrpxI03L5MtPD0eO6pxGJ9DvZkCWVCaXiTO6oSen4PpDOLghYHo%2B4Vpqvo3%2FpROjCxToAEvdKcvazzutHXo%2FsJlsjoo%2Fmx%2B1Ek92%2BufvnULE1KShcl4rj7BNA4T9Jjuo0ja%2BLxer65UO9tkrad6HgKA9hXXtyDBrlAmhTDWFKsmcmq2ihTQ7PrDCl4pCLBjqlAVM272WWPnlOeGyGQ9vB3AQrwELsHDPU0KiSwP4QYEOtuC3iFTxC%2FXRs42S51Jb7aTjsW4m6tY2xevuwO4tmkEyWJnLxLHRvktGKLmigB4rFLjusFml2FTXw5xWvfY786%2F8KQpyklyKdvZKCIlTGk1BlxxAAC17iJ1VlZV%2BzWSY7WJd1%2Fhm%2BXXw9P5X6Ch%2Fx17cYnn0uAeICgpjy1lOaC5Wkd0STsQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=e6c376c71a4042011642c27650cce833ea9405483ade7a8b0728c71c746aebd7","file_size":173338,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":7,"voters":["albinowax","spam404","greensec","spetr0x","dolph1n","911","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":804909,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @albinowax,\n\nThank you for reporting this issue.
