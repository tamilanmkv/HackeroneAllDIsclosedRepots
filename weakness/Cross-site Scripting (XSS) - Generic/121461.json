I started looking for DNS entries that were still pointing to S3 buckets that however no longer exist. It appears this was the case for `a2.bime.io`, which points to an Amazon S3 website bucket in the US East region. \n\n# Steps to Reproduce\n- Resolve `a2.bime.io` and see what is behind it:\n\n```\nmichiel@msp ~ $ dig A a2.bime.io @8.8.8.8                                                                                                [2.1.8]\n\n; \u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e DiG 9.9.5-11ubuntu1.2-Ubuntu \u003c\u003c\u003e\u003e A a2.bime.io @8.8.8.8\n;; global options: +cmd\n;; Got answer:\n;; -\u003e\u003eHEADER\u003c\u003c- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 730\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 3, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n\n;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\n; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 512\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;a2.bime.io.\t\t\tIN\tA\n\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\na2.bime.io.\t\t59\tIN\tCNAME\tbimeio.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com.\nbimeio.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com. 59 IN CNAME s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com.\ns3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com. 4 IN A\t54.231.11.130\n\n;; Query time: 210 msec\n;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)\n;; WHEN: Tue Mar 08 15:33:45 EST 2016\n;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 124\n```\n\n- It points to an Amazon S3 bucket in the S3 US East 1 region. Visiting http://a2.bime.io revealed that the bucket did not exist (a 404 error was shown). Obviously this is not the case any longer, as the bucket is now claimed and serving a fake login page (see \"Attack Scenario\").\n- I created a bucket with name \"a2.bime.io\" on my S3 account in the US East 1 region.\n- I enabled static website hosting and pointed \"index.html\" as the index document.\n- Then I uploaded `index.html` (attached to this report) and clicked \"Make public\" to make sure it can be served. \n- Now go to http://a2.bime.io and you will see a BIME login page. Click the Sign In button and you will notice it is a fake login form. \n\n# Attack Scenario \nI created a false login page and posted it on http://a2.bime.io. The login page looks just like the normal BIME sign in page, but it is 100% controlled by the attacker. The attacker could harvest logins by convincing their victims to visit the fake login page. Since it is a subdomain of `bime.io`, which BIME customers will recognize, it is likely they will fall for the attack. \n\nI have attached the fake login page here as `index.html`.\n\n# Remediation\nRemove the `a2.bime.io` DNS entry so it no longer points to an S3 bucket Zendesk Ops doesn't control. If you need me to release `a2.bime.io` as an S3 bucket, let me know and I'll delete the bucket.\n\n","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":77313,"file_name":"index.html","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/077/313/b614e6976e90eff388116f745d38f372d144c305/index.html?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22index.html%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27index.html\u0026response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQRJF6VFL6%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T133246Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCID1So1KYRjOmBFJqLsqO1j9SSUCF9kJ%2FHqahOyDLmrnJAiAr2q5Z8bAgCyaCmyDSz7xwtmUTDOoz04myJOluBHRCeyqDBAju%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMvFUMWX6P00RsVarQKtcDflFFNScU3coA1YbnKy4lPXtwGDNsJcqhfcCTaePuAuK6nWvl5xRbjzjOBPvBHaTAnb2Iw%2B6Jdj2uyjmRMn%2F5%2F5AzD5di2wWOcC0am9iLaFmORG4VIVXTc8aAiiwqjNAu7dH2hTUNL9bwPzYUBq3%2FjwvNZUM%2FmpdXfugOwAP%2FP3w9e9PqozA16XzrwGIunimlg58HKZfOM0xp%2FESLFXRHAssX6DaYqQQyV5%2F0triAQeOx328GOBUjfGTiAl1aoS1J0%2FqN%2BmywXW%2FqqkEfAQ2n2f18dX2dkbwMnyQ4F47zR6jJw3CdBkeCPRDbbhcu8YGu2%2F%2BzzM9B4uguhR76M3KYB3dr919eRp%2F%2BcOfUxc8TC3gXMmp1jh0ywwC27sBrzUgZdh%2B2g4artPxRaRZPHbQvC%2F1OZ0MxZYsQmEItbUc65WqfO6PSdLbymEFDMyN5ona14j%2BaQHfp1MWNaO02I2WPYO5mZIsPuHjCO5MYUldcsrZMP7pydKVo87gkO2fPB2orxw1RGazxVwGy5R2PDIV7HsKH4KSOqhGLTTYcSjZvxzmTWIy013yrXhU3CEdFUoB7QifSN1bUli2cMIaUe7sr75onhlaNnQxqLv%2By7jqQ9RiOHvcMM4XIMInwkIsGOqYBzgDHFUI%2FtkToYUBHsGsXyI9vGkS81IUV4PSjgSfvCFIGR%2BPjro3EYi30Oc%2FQZijhik3H1oI82Vno5zo%2BVnueR7%2BkGCloKvMkJAe%2F77e%2BPPRDClquvRG9ERm7ELsd6WvljYOJTmuP4pWPW%2B2d%2BQu26lThNein0I5abJKiu%2FYvnXDmBeYAgLMwbyg9Lq3qT5qMKsr3i1aOgHcGHtYldnzNcLqwaNJYhw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=45a016d800797b592f99e5f19b38b7b0c2afb3ef74556d38f8d52fe008811523","file_size":6632,"type":"text/html"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-07-22T01:57:09.270Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-164806537.11874714,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":75,"voters":["dirk","tomdev","fransrosen","jobert","harisec","michiel","pnig0s","dawgyg","niemand_sec","gerben_javado","and 65 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":829796,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @michiel,\n\nThank you for reporting this issue.
