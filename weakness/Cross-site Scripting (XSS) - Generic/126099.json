An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript in the administrative Dashboard of WordPress. The script would be evaluated under administrator privileges (as only logged-in administrators can view the Dashboard). Such script can use AJAX calls to achieve a server-side compromise unless some kind of special protections are in place.\n\nThe script can be injected by causing an error condition in the calendar plugin. One way to trigger an error is described below. Whenever this happens, the plugin disables itself and places an error message \"banner\" in the administrative Dashboard and shows it to any administrator who logs on afterwards.\n\nThe error details can be manipulated by the attacker and special HTML characters aren't filtered. The error message includes e.g. the URL which triggered the error, which is controllable by the attacker.\n\n#Reproducing#\n\nThe attack requires sending a malformed HTTP request *without* encoding special characters in the URL. Therefore this can't be done with a normal web browser. For example a PERL script like this produces the request:\n~~~~perl\n#!/usr/bin/perl\nopen(NC,\"|openssl s_client -connect drive.uber.com:443 -quiet\") || die;\nprint NC \"GET /oh/?ai1ec_js_widget=ai1ec_agenda_widget\u0026render=true\u0026events_per_page=$%\u0026xss=\u003csvg/onload=alert(/stored-xss/.source)\u003e\\r\\n\";\n HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\";\nprint NC \"Host: drive.uber.com\\r\\n\";\nprint NC \"\\r\\n\";\nclose(NC);\n~~~~\nThe HTTP response is a redirect back to the \"front page\", meaning the plugin couldn't render the calendar JSON data as supposed, but encountered an error condition.\n\nReproducing this of course requires that the plugin is reactivated (it's is currently disabled because I tested this).\n\nNext, when an administrator logs on the system and is presented with the WordPress Dashboard, they should get an alert box, showing that the attacker-supplied JavaScript has been stored in the Dashboard.\n\nInjecting another code won't work until the plugin is reactivated.\n\n#Details#\n\nThe error in this case is an invalid format string in an SQL query, caused by the malformed *events_per_page* parameter. The XSS payload is included later in the URL above and gets included in the error message.\n\nI have tested this bug on a local test server running WordPress and the All In One Event Calendar plugin. The difference is that instead of nginx my test server runs Apache. This, or other aspects of your server architecture *might* introduce differences in URL encoding etc. which could prevent the example from working (I'll test with nginx later).\n\n#Impact#\n\nInstead of showing an alert box, the script could use AJAX functions to e.g. create a new administrator user with a known password, or write arbitrary PHP code on the server via the plugin or theme editors. I've referred to such demonstrations in my previous reports.\n\n#Fix#\n\nI haven't reported this to the plugin author yet. One way to protect against this is to comment out the error detail generation in the file wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-event-calendar/lib/exception/handler.php, end of file (not tested).","bounty_amount":"2000.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,000","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-05-14T05:11:50.232Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-170756611.84182203,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":5,"voters":["ashish_r_padelkar","eveeez","michaelrowley","spetr0x","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":874981,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"As a status update on this one, we are working to get the proper accounts for our Wordpress instances.

The most common examples of microsites include Uber city sites, blogs, and partner incentive sites.\n\n\u003eAre Uber microsites (for example, city-specific Uber sites and blogs) in scope?\n\u003eMicrosites are an important part of how Uber reaches people in diverse local markets all around the world. Since they have smaller audiences, shouldn't contain much or any user data and aren’t part of the uber.com domain space, the impact of issues on these sites is significantly less severe. Since we are primary interested in vulnerabilities which could lead to the exfiltration of customer information, vulnerabilities in microsite services will not be rewarded for except in extraordinary circumstances. Generally there are better areas to spend your time than microsites.\n\nThe goal of this section was to encompass all cases, like these Wordpress cases, where the security impact of a flaw is blunted. I now realize that this part \"aren’t part of the uber.com domain space\" is what the problem is on this ticket. I will be changing this language to cover what you found here, microsites that happened to live under the `.uber.com` domain. When we wrote that we were using \"part of the uber.com domain space\" as shorthand for what should really be \"access to internal Uber systems or data\" which is what we were attempted to convey.\n\nSo overall I would say we attempted to make this clear but its an ongoing project to best convey what we are looking for.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-04-27T18:19:37.691Z","updated_at":"2016-04-27T18:19:37.691Z","actor":{"username":"mandatoryuber","cleared":false,"url":"/mandatoryuber","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/040/287/fe7ca43da855a13d789192535962231dc7bee6ec_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":939055,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\u003e I hope you can agree with the premise that bugs are correct to be awarded based on impact ...\n\nIt would be correct to award based on your written reward policy, like happened with my first bounty.\n\n\u003e Other times from the outside researchers are surprised that their bug had less impact than expected, like this case.\n\nAs far as I understand, there is nothing surprising about the impact of these bugs - they're exactly what I reported from the start, \"Remote code execution on a production server\".\n\nIn about half of the cases your rewards aren't even impact-based but \"ease-of-fixing-based\" (referring to explanation at #125594). Sure, there could be 20 bugs which are easy to fix by disabling everything. It doesn't follow that impact of 19 of them was zero.\n\nHow does the hypotethical thought of 20 theoretical bugs nullify the real bugs I reported? The risk of running software containing 20 bugs is higher, not lower than with 1 bug per software. That is so unintuitive that it would have been fair to mention it.\n\nI don't think conforming to your own written policy should be \"unrealistic\". **If** you think your system really has so many bugs that it's unrealistic for a multi-billion company to reward them, then launching a bounty program wasn't a good idea and clearly someone (many of them) didn't do their job. But I did, your security was substantially improved as a result, and most of my work getting dismissed as worthless is not good.\n\nAnd for the record, ranting about this may seem pointless due to your [stated](http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/03/uber-bug-bounty-program/) and apparent reluctance to negotiate about the bounties. However I think it's a good thing to discuss the conventions and practices of bug bounties in general. I'm not just worried about 2 lost weeks, but the longer run. Making bounty policies consistent, predictable, and trustworthy benefits everyone and vice versa.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-03T19:40:55.914Z","updated_at":"2016-05-03T19:48:42.901Z","actor":{"username":"jouko","cleared":false,"url":"/jouko","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/013/642/e4fdbdb735ac2b938c6eb072303166bc708a9a50_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":957083,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-14T05:11:55.529Z","updated_at":"2016-05-14T05:11:55.529Z","actor":{"url":"/uber","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/314/24ea21370a71b18eafb5722d5855825ab622b5dd_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Uber"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":957366,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Since this is public I'd like to update and straighten the record a bit. It turned out WP admin scripts *could* be used to execute arbitrary server-side code despite disabled plugin/theme editing. Also, WP sites *could* be used as an entry point to the internal system at least in one case.\n\nBoth issues were demonstrated and confirmed in other reports. These were taken into account with *one* of my reports as an impact bonus. Other bounties based on the misassumption(s) remain unchanged.\n\nIn general, it doesn't seem like a harmless non-issue that an attacker can control systems used by thousands of Uber employees and perhaps millions of customers. Regarding the rationale that \"there isn't **any risk** of our user data being stolen via this issue\" I beg to differ.\n\nAs just one example, my cookies on drive.uber.com include my email address which I entered on one of the \"core\" websites. A malicious attacker with access to drive.uber.com could covertly add code that checks this cookie and if found, presents a dialog asking the user to confirm their Uber username and password. Displaying the valid email address and showing the dialog on a legitimate https-protected uber.com website would make the success rate relatively high.\n\nOr, an exact replica of the OneLogin dialog could be displayed to Uber employees logging on drive.uber.com, saying login failed or expired (username/email known). The credentials could then be used to gain access to the internal system. So I would say there is at least *some* risk.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-14T13:33:10.119Z","updated_at":"2016-05-14T13:33:10.119Z","actor":{"username":"jouko","cleared":false,"url":"/jouko","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/013/642/e4fdbdb735ac2b938c6eb072303166bc708a9a50_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
