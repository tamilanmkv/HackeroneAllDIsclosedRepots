So I took a look at that.\nI was able to include my HTML codes to manipulate emails sent to my address.\nThe *Name* field in the subscription form doesn't validate the name to strip html tags.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n1. Go to any job link ( *eg. http://www.joinolx.com/careers/job/166318* )\n2. Now from the left side Click on *Subscribe to our job alert*\n3. In the Name field enter `\u003ch1\u003e\u003cfont color=\"red\"\u003eSubscription service Hacked by Zawad\u003c/font\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e`\n4. Enter your email, select random country and job position and click *Send*\nCheck your email and you will see the manipulated email.\n\n**Risk**\nAn attacker can deliberately send malicious email from this service to make victim believe it was actually sent by OLX (and when it comes to Job service everyone would believe everything LOL)\n\nThe fix can be pretty simple to remove the tags or disallowing the html tags in the Name field. (it is never expected that a Name field will contain HTML tags).\n\nHope you resolve and reward.\n\nThanks.\n\n-----\nZawad\n\n","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) -
