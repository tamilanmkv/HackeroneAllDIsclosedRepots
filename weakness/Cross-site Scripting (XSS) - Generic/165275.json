The PoC can be adapted to work on other domains.*\n\nExpected result:\n\n{F116792}\n\n## Vulnerability Details\n\nThe vulnerability exists because OX treats files attached to unencrypted emails differently than files attached to decrypted emails. \n\nWhen an HTML file is attached to an **unencrypted** email, the user can click \"Open in browser\" to view the contents of the HTML file. This file will have been sanitized by the OX backend.\n\nWhen an HTML file is attached to a **decrypted** email, clicking on \"Open in browser\" will cause OX to open the HTML file without sanitizing it first. At this point, JS code inside the HTML file will be executed on the same domain as the OX application.\n\nSimilar inconsistencies in the application logic can be observed for SVG files. Whereas for unencrypted emails OX instructs the web browser to download the SVG file, this is not the case for SVG files attached to decrypted emails. Instead, the SVG file will be opened in the web browser, leading to the execution of embedded JS code and subsequently Stored XSS. **Other file types may be affected as well.**\n\n\n## Bypassing Content Security Policy\n\nThe program rules are not clear as to whether a vulnerability has to be exploitable only on a default installation (which may not send CSP headers) or also on the provided [sandbox](https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/) (which does send them). Assuming the latter, I had to find a way to bypass the CSP.\n\nThe sandbox sends the following headers:\n\n```\nContent-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'\nX-WebKit-CSP: script-src 'self'\nX-Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self'\n[...]\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\n```\n\nWhile the CSP would successfully prevent the execution of JS embedded in the previously mentioned HTML/SVG files, it still allows for the loading of JS from external files, as long as they share the same origin. \n\nIn order to make a malicious, attacker-crafted JS file ( {F116785} ) share the same origin with the CSP protected page, the JS file can be uploaded to the OX server via the Drive module. The JS file can then be made accessible to the victim by sharing it (menu: `Share \u003e Get link`). OX returns a link (\"URL-1\") to access the shared file:\n\n{F116786}\n\nSample link: `https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/ajax/share/04c917a807019a414c917f87019a484e8f3ecfaeb0ef0e0c/1/8/MzQ/MzQvMg`\n\nThis link will not open the JS file itself, but a preview page. The actual URL (\"URL-2\") of the JS file can be obtained by pressing the \"Open attachment\" button:\n\n{F116787}\n\nSample link: `https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/appsuite/api/files/ext.js?action=document\u0026folder=10\u0026id=10%2F2\u0026version=1\u0026user=9\u0026context=80\u0026sequence=1472804350823\u00269.80.1472804350823\u0026delivery=view`\n\nURL-2 can be used to load the JS file from within an HTML file:\n\n```\n\u003cscript src=\"https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/appsuite/api/files/ext.js?action=document\u0026folder=10\u0026id=10%2F2\u0026version=1\u0026user=9\u0026context=80\u0026sequence=1472804350823\u00269.80.1472804350823\u0026delivery=view\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nHowever, when a client attempts to access URL-2 before having received a cookie from URL-1, OX responds with an error message instead of the JS code:\n\n```\nBad Request\n\nSVL-0002 Categories=ERROR Message='Missing cookie: open-xchange-public-session-V4VUFwKeyL8GQ3dB2IHQ. Please re-login.' exceptionID=1425497541-54297\n```\n\nThis restriction can be bypassed by loading URL-1 within an iframe:\n\n```\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/ajax/share/04c917a807019a414c917f87019a484e8f3ecfaeb0ef0e0c/1/8/MzQ/MzQvMg\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\n\u003cscript src=\"https://sandbox.open-xchange.com/appsuite/api/files/ext.js?action=document\u0026folder=10\u0026id=10%2F2\u0026version=1\u0026user=9\u0026context=80\u0026sequence=1472804350823\u00269.80.1472804350823\u0026delivery=view\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n```\n\nBecause the browser has to load URL-1 before URL-2 for the attack to succeed, the attached file `xss-file.html` includes a Meta Refresh to make the exploit more reliable. The Meta Refresh reloads the page after five seconds, which is useful in case the browser had attempted to load URL-2 before receiving the required cookie from URL-1. By the time the Meta Refresh causes the page (and subsequently URL-2) to be reloaded, the browser should have received this cookie from URL-1. \n\nAs I have mentioned before, I'm not sure whether a CSP bypass is required by the program rules, so I don't want to spend too much time on optimizing the CSP bypass. Anyway, the actual vulnerability is the rendering of unsanitized data as described in the `Vulnerability Details` part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","bounty_amount":"300.0","formatted_bounty":"$300","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) -

Considering that #164821, #165019 and #165275 were all triaged on the same day and within 20 minutes, I felt that the patch may well be the result of my reports.\n\nToday I found that code within a third party's OX Guard installation has been changed in a way that addresses the three vulnerabilities I reported in #164821, #165019 and #165275, and I have been able to confirm that the third party is indeed using OX Guard version v2.4.2-rev6.\n\nI understand that bounty decisions may require some additional time.

We started working on them as fast as possible, regardless of the status with HackerOne. Note that we're transferring reports from HackerOne to our defect tracker and do not use HackerOne for the actual tracking/resolution process.\n\nNow, regarding your concern: I've just update your reports and researcher credits will be contained with our public advisories on Bugtraq. I understand those tickets were idle for a long time and i'm gratefully sorry to let you wait. We had issues with the recent change in Billing with HackerOne. Transferring money from Germany to the US, then to HackerOne and then splitting to our 3 bounty programs was a bit troublesome and took a long time.\n\nThe decision with regards to bounty is already done and was quite straight forward, we simply had no balance left on HackerOne due to the billing change (pre-paid (new) vs. invoicing (old)). I wanted to be sure we can compensate right after putting your tickets to resolved, i'll do that first day in the morning tomorrow.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-09-25T12:26:05.617Z","updated_at":"2016-09-25T12:27:48.369Z","actor":{"username":"mheiland","cleared":false,"url":"/mheiland","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/425JKsXEnCYsDU1VA48SXXZV/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"open-xchange","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1214819,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-09-25T12:26:45.933Z","updated_at":"2016-09-25T12:26:45.933Z","actor":{"username":"mheiland","cleared":false,"url":"/mheiland","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/425JKsXEnCYsDU1VA48SXXZV/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"dejavuln","url":"/dejavuln"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"open-xchange","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1215258,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Alright, thanks for the quick reply.
