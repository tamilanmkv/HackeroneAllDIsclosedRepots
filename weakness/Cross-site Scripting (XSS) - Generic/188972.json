You can verify this by looking up the IP address for this subdomain and noting that it does not resolve. Through registering that domain on elastic beanstalk and deploying a webserver that responds to that request with javascript, an attacker could get a persistent XSS on Starbuck's website. \n\nI have not registered that domain with Elastic Beanstalk since it would give me a large amount of information about the user's of Starbuck's website (and it would incur a large amount of traffic-more than I'd like to pay for on AWS!). If you would like me to do so, let me know but I do not want to go past the bounds of acceptable testing. \n\nThanks,\nDavid Dworken","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-02-12T03:42:53.407Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-147089657.01586413,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":35,"voters":["hogarth45","inhibitor181","bogdantcaciuc","bl4de","fillawful","zombiehelp54","dilawer01","mdv","mlitchfield","edoverflow","and 25 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1349578,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @ddworken \n\nThank you for sending this in.
