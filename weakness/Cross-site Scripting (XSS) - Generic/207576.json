This meant that anyone could sign up for Amazon S3, claim the bucket as their own and then serve content on s3.shopify.com.\n\nDNS record:\n```\ns3.shopify.com.\t\t3599\tIN\tCNAME\tshopify-assets.s3.amazonaws.com.\nshopify-assets.s3.amazonaws.com. 7518 IN CNAME\ts3-directional-w.amazonaws.com.\ns3-directional-w.amazonaws.com.\t7218 IN\tCNAME\ts3-1-w.amazonaws.com.\ns3-1-w.amazonaws.com.\t4\tIN\tA\t52.216.80.56\n```\n\n\n**Impact**\nThis could be used as stored XSS by uploading a HTML page.\n\nGiven that the attacker could control all the content (even at /), it could also make for a pretty convincing phishing page.\n\nLast, if any of your application relies on s3.shopify.com any of the data sent/fetched there could be controlled by an attacker.\n\n**Mitigation/PoC**\nI have claimed the bucket on my account and disabled use except for the following URL:\nhttp://s3.shopify.com/xss_unguessable3211231232.html\n\nThis means that nobody else can claim the bucket and add content.\n\n**Fix**\nRemove the s3.shopify.com DNS entry. Alternatively, if you wish to use s3.shopify.com with S3, tell me in a comment and I will remove the bucket from my Amazon account.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":11,"voters":["drsniper","bogdantcaciuc","avlidienbrunn","encrypt","powerjacobb1","harry_mg","eveeez","dpgribkov","sumit7","spetr0x","and 1 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1496916,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Thank you for your report. \n\nIt appears that the subdomain was unused; none of our applications were pointing at it.
