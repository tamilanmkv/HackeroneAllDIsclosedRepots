Vulnerable code is in `full.js`:\n\n```js\nvar DR = Z(DS) + \"/content/\" + k(DQ) + \"/contents.js\";\n```\n\nThat allows to execute absolutely arbitrary javascript in the context on `teavana.com` domain. As described in #202011 that directly leads to theft of customer account data and account takeover, hence I set severity to Critical.\n\nAlso, I have discovered a number of other XSS attacks on similar pages, involving other parameters and sinks.
