I ran it about 5 times and it usually took between 1 and 8 minutes, with about `2.75 million` tests per minute.\n\nThinking through the details, it seems like it's extremely unlikely that this would be successfully used in a real world attack.\n\nWhen Core displays comment authors in wp-admin, it escapes the address with `esc_url()`, and I don't think there are many themes that display the email address on the front-end, in order to protect privacy.\n\nEven if a plugin or theme did display the address unescaped, the victim would still need to visit a page showing the comment, which seems very unlikely if there are millions of comments to navigate through. At that point it's also likely that the attacker would be stopped by other means (Akismet, the site owner disabling comments out of frustration, etc).\n\nGiven all the mitigating factors, I think this can probably be considered a low-priority hardening enhancement, and worked on publicly on core.trac.wordpress.org.\n\nBefore we do that, though, I wanted to get your thoughts, in case I'm missing something.
