It detects the protocol (URI scheme) by using the first colon character. It compares the identified protocol with a list of good protocols to ensure it is safe. \n\nAs this function is used to parse HTML-encoded attributes as well, it also uses HTML-encoded variants of the colon character as shown below:\n```\n   $string2 = preg_split( '/:|\u0026#0*58;|\u0026#x0*3a;/i', $string, 2 );\n```\n\nHowever, the above function is flawed as it does not include HTML-encoded parameters that do not use a semicolon character afterwards. See \"Decimal HTML character references without trailing semicolons\" and \"Hexadecimal HTML character references without trailing semicolons\" at https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet for more information about the issue.\n\nThe following HTML code shows an example that can bypass the wp_kses_bad_protocol_once validation (see it in action at https://jsfiddle.net/x103n1f7/1/):\n```\n\u003ca href=\"javascript\u0026#58alert(document.domain)\"\u003eJS - Numerical Entities\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"javascript\u0026#x3ax=1;alert(document.domain)\"\u003eJS - Hex Entities\u003c/a\u003e\n```\n\nThe following fix is suggested by adding one line of code at the first line of the wp_kses_bad_protocol_once function to add a semicolon character after the html-encoded variants of the colon character when it is missing. The function will look like this:\n\n```\nfunction wp_kses_bad_protocol_once($string, $allowed_protocols, $count = 1 ) {\n///////////////// suggested fix starts here\n    $string = preg_replace( '/(\u0026#0*58(?![;0-9])|\u0026#x0*3a(?![;a-f0-9]))/i' , \"$1;\" , $string );\n///////////////// suggested fix ends here\n    $string2 = preg_split( '/:|\u0026#0*58;|\u0026#x0*3a;/i', $string, 2 );\n    if ( isset($string2[1]) \u0026\u0026 ! preg_match('%/\\?%', $string2[0]) ) {\n        $string = trim( $string2[1] );\n        $protocol = wp_kses_bad_protocol_once2( $string2[0], $allowed_protocols );\n        if ( 'feed:' == $protocol ) {\n            if ( $count \u003e 2 )\n                return '';\n            $string = wp_kses_bad_protocol_once( $string, $allowed_protocols, ++$count );\n            if ( empty( $string ) )\n                return $string;\n        }\n        $string = $protocol . $string;\n    }\n \n    return $string;\n}\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nThis can lead to reflected or stored cross-site scripting attacks for the core or the modules that only rely on this function for the validation.","bounty_amount":"350.0","formatted_bounty":"$350","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-11-16T20:06:35.822Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-60028873.26227155,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":34,"voters":["foobar7","moblig","bl4de","sameerphad72","mik317","ali","zayn1337","sudi","enesdexh1","khizer47","and 24 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":2750,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"WordPress Core","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2659799,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I was wondering if you have any update on this please?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-04-24T13:31:53.230Z","updated_at":"2018-04-24T13:31:53.230Z","actor":{"username":"irsdl","cleared":true,"url":"/irsdl","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpress","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2680168,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks so much for your responsible disclosure and clear report, @irsdl.\n\nYour report looks valid at first glance.
