While other user agents don't support the href attribute for MathML elements (yet), Firefox does and thereby enables passive JavaScript execution. Note that supporting href for MathML elements is a feature - introduced with MathML 3. The same effect can be observed by using xlink:href. The statusline action further enables obfuscation of the actual link target - and in this example hides the JavaScript URI.\n\nStep to reproduce\n1- Login to your mopub account.\n2- Go to account settings.\n3- Click on Edit user settings.\n4- Add this payload in Title field \n\n\u003cmath href=\"javascript:alert(1)\"\u003eCLICKME\u003c/math\u003e\n\n\u003cmath\u003e\n\u003c!-- up to FF 13 --\u003e\n\u003cmaction actiontype=\"statusline#http://google.com\" xlink:href=\"javascript:alert(2)\"\u003eCLICKME\u003c/maction\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- FF 14+ --\u003e\n\u003cmaction actiontype=\"statusline\" xlink:href=\"javascript:alert(3)\"\u003eCLICKME\u003cmtext\u003ehttp://http://google.com\u003c/mtext\u003e\u003c/maction\u003e\n\u003c/math\u003e\n\n5- Click on Submit Button.\n6- HTML link will be stored in account Title.\n7- Click on that html link and XSS will be executed in Firefox.\n\nPOC\nPlease see the images in the attachment.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe vulnerability allow a malicious user to inject html tags and execute Javascript  which could lead to steal user's session","weakness":{"id":60,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic"},"original_report_id":485748,"original_report_url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/485748","attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":12,"voters":["ali","0-1","cr4xerbik4sh","z41b1337_","cryptographer","tej333","zubaid","h_adnane","zmrdevj","syhbt","and 2 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":1074,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"mopub.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4237819,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your report @z41b1337.\n\nWe are reviewing the behavior that you described, and we will get back to you when we have more information.\n\nThank you for thinking of Twitter security.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-03-01T19:19:52.145Z","updated_at":"2019-03-01T19:19:52.145Z","actor":{"username":"bugtriage-alex","cleared":false,"url":"/bugtriage-alex","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4254502,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugDuplicate","message":"Thank you for the report.
