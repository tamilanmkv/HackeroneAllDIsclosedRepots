I think giving `jQuery.html` and `el.innerHTML`  DOM API is a great example of how this issue should be fixed.\n\n`jQuery.html` offers a clear understanding on what it does. set the html of the element. \nUser who knows how html works and it's full potential can understand that the `html` method will have side effects if not treated carefully, just in case a documentation explanation was added.\n\nMDN documentation for `innerHTML` does the same but also mention an alternative use `Node.textContent` if you don't need html.\n\nThis three important fixes are missing from bootbox -\n1. it is not clear the `alert` method is actually handling strings or any input as html instead of text\n2. there is no alternative to use a secure method that will treat is as text like `jQuery.text` and `Node.textContent`\n3. there is no clear documentation on the `alert` method or any other method to point to this problem and it's solution\n\nFixing the documentation is highly valuable but only after the first two issues are addressed as well (It doesn't help if there is no alternative and users don't always read the documentation)\n\nI want to make it clear using HTML in dialogues is an important feature and I'm not suggesting to remove it or add any kind of sanitation to it.\n\nOn a side note there is now a few suggestion to reduce the risks of XSS even more when using `innerHTML`
