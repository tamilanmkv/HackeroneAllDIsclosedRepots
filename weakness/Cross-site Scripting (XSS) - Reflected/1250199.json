XSS occurs when a web application makes use of unvalidated or unencoded user input within the output it generates.\n\n## Impact\n\nMalicious JavaScript has access to all the same objects as the rest of the web page, including access to cookies and local storage, which are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user's session cookie, they can then impersonate that user.\n\nFurthermore, JavaScript can read and make arbitrary modifications to the contents of a page being displayed to a user. Therefore, XSS in conjunction with some clever social engineering opens up a lot of possibilities for an attacker.\n\n## System Host(s)\n█████\n\n## Affected Product(s) and Version(s)\n\n\n## CVE Numbers\n\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\nurl: poc\nhttps://www.███████/███████url=https://www.███████/%22%3Cscript%3Ealert(String.fromCharCode(88,%20115,%20115,%2032,%2066,%20121,%2032,%2079,%20108,%20100,%2077,%20111,%20104,%2097,%20109,%20109))%3C/script%3E\n█████\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\n\n","weakness":{"id":61,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":5,"voters":["zhenwarx","dnelsaka","hackersbh1","nostrocybersec","rajeev0hack"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":12333330,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
