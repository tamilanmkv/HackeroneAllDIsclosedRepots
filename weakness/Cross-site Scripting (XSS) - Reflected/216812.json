An attacker could send a malicious link (that contains the manipulated URL) to a legitimate user that he is logged in and simulate the login screen to stole the password (phishing), or multiple attacks more, like XSS.\n\nThe Nextcloud/Owncloud application contains multiple security headers of HTTP, so, inject scripts or redirect to another websites is difficult, the problem is that not all the browser supports these headers (fortunatelly, the most used browsers yes).\n\nExist more options to attack, for example, redirect the content of an \u003cobject\u003e or \u003cscript\u003e to a saved and shared items of your directory. Also, the mimetypes are well configured and the most browsers will not execute a javascript file that doesn't have the javascript content-type.\n\nAnyway, all the mitigations are well, but these aren't never-falling. So the solution to this vulnerability is sanitize the output before to deliver the HTML to the final user.\n\nAlso, another security flaw is showed, but the impact is less, it is a full path disclosure and it show the full path of the Nextcloud/Owncloud installation.\n\nPoC (Proof of Concept):\n\nhttps://nextcloud-site/index.php/apps/files/ajax/download.php?files=%00\u0026dir=\u003c/p\u003eHTMLCODE\n\nI tested it in the last version.\n\nIf you need more information, ask to me.\n\nRegards,\n","bounty_amount":"450.0","formatted_bounty":"$450","weakness":{"id":61,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-06-07T12:20:05.411Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-137123136.4706298,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":28,"voters":["lukasreschke","sp1d3rs","secator","hunter","michiel","bl4de","flashdisk","mpz","supernatural","eveeez","and 18 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.5,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1569076,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us!\n\nOur security team will take a look at this issue as soon as possible.
