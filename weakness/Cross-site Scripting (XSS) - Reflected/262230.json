This does not violate the XFO 'DENY' setting (https://app.shopify.com//services/mobile_app/rte)\n  * Victim releases the mouse button after loading the tinymce and the dragged data gets rendered by tinymce (tinymce is fullscreen so it doesn't matter where you drop it on the screen)\n\nWhile I couldn't get a tinymce XSS to trigger it does illustrate an attacker can make tinymce render something.

It's version 4.3.something and no working XSS could be found.\n\nIn Firefox it is possible to drag multiple items at once. When for example text is selected and the dragstart event is dispatched, both items will be present in the event.dataTransfer. This confused tinymce.\nThis combined with a video onloadstart followed by a source element to trick the browser to load \u0026 dispatch the event will trigger a XSS.\n\nTo select the text of an element automatically in JavaScript we do the following.\n```\n  var selection = window.getSelection();\n  var range = document.createRange();\n  range.selectNodeContents(document.getElementById(\"drag\"));\n  selection.removeAllRanges();\n  selection.addRange(range);\n\n```\n\nAnd adding an event for dragstart would look like this:\n\n```\n        el.addEventListener(\"dragstart\", function(ev){\n                ev.dataTransfer.setData('text/html', '\u003cvideo onloadstart=\"document.write(/xss/)\"\u003e\u003csource/\u003e');\n                document.location='https://app.shopify.com//services/mobile_app/rte';\n        });\n```\n\nThe idea is that the victim will drag and release the video element while having the text selected essentially dragging 2 objects at once.\n\nSince the font must be dragged I made it huge \u0026 auto select it.\n\nThere is preloading going on in the background already from the beginning. This to smoothen the transition from dragstart to drop. The app.shopify.com target must be fully loaded before the mouse button is released. I managed to bring that process down to quite a bit.\n\nThe payload is automatically encoded just to make things easier.\n\nX-Frame-Options is set to 'DENY'. This doesn't matter because we do a document.location change \u0026\u0026 drop.\n\nI know that there is privileged functionality on this domain. Only the CSRF token is required to make requests to that location.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-22T23:34:16.836Z","updated_at":"2017-08-22T23:34:16.836Z","actor":{"username":"jelmer","cleared":true,"url":"/jelmer","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/012/636/5497b7f89b51e0320e32f2fd125a6dc9fe7e11dd_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"attachments":[{"id":215030,"filename":"demo.mp4","type":"video/mp4","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/215/030/23d6a43a96dedd44e6a602c98de12daf530a9a9b/demo.mp4?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22demo.mp4%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27demo.mp4\u0026response-content-type=video%2Fmp4\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQZV3IBMDT%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T143254Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHx%2BIgfH0%2FRLQqbPD5vv6PNps92HY0yneL0kxkNwZHOyAiALrXRJqTvQQGm0xEkYGCB0kbPjUCCkzSeRztvcuetAYyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIM5FTPTB1nK4gXIBLuKtcDHmLbKhsWpyXKgWy1fAYOf0DZEqCEqF9ns7RwihS1bFM9%2BSDXYY0CmIqutWQhK5asoL8jbJZ39%2FJ2eai2SoxTlg3PhjMpNNSUfPFgauwX6vt%2FoeK9VnB1Hmqg6bCNA62qIJPnlTONluGngv604Y6CnYL9Se%2B%2BjgOpqhqmIOX9KlzGAoRM0Ci%2BrWGdELH8Q66bSHmapdLHPWMoGBEj%2BeruK3oCs%2BDaUQ1aE%2FEQ8R5PgqLM3Pq6DrZV9PlFixmkikk8SpDcsFEiT0Zw0gsy2qPz3z3BHAEuG64GguAhIs5FvYP7HbdpPv7rQz4QSDXgN3SIbVD0A4kcV1iNQpZyiw2rmdxuUWIk46d%2FT0u%2B7j9yAdfpDuPVKPDHJD35k0pB6VLe7RtlSwwvcDUa7LL6FJxvOPpupIMPSy51BJl9%2Bf8022a6pcy263zeRDGJjALAc6brW%2BvQoDUu%2FQP%2BdxwOLZvXCyyGJp2%2BK86jg8qU%2FLWZ4DVeR3bIO1n7Fw%2B53iFlBIMatC3ZSLlV1J7dSDCk74u6OWvql%2Brvb6q%2Bj8NHQK6luFckQV%2B9okMhTYuNniW3sHS8rjyNrrGhP8vMtxMzink9EL%2FmU0Oxusg2wmaXCDfIKpDDmspvZQv8MJ%2F%2FkIsGOqYBaz2hfRV48KDU0Mx0UomuXdEWK6oszm51EnI%2FeSepVmINgIWWggB7gENawN0rgfpMSIqQjB%2BpErtoDw1jNWaknZlAG9GLkCZ49lNHNirjr7iPk7LouunUzSZjaag8Yc19L8BAWjyLZnHXpqUZQRBSoqOcAoct3F46M7AzK2ewXHmh7aKY3cfAQTu9yVTJd2CDpuLtlyUDUa37BJ8%2F84puzgJS34jmeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=4e517c547a3b6d36ee1533d388358049c34fd5dc5139399b6ad6ddaa6ca4c51c"},{"id":215029,"filename":"exploit.html","type":"text/html","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/215/029/6170834c1d67078815a52788358c6f05baa28575/exploit.html?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22exploit.html%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27exploit.html\u0026response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQZV3IBMDT%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T143254Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIHx%2BIgfH0%2FRLQqbPD5vv6PNps92HY0yneL0kxkNwZHOyAiALrXRJqTvQQGm0xEkYGCB0kbPjUCCkzSeRztvcuetAYyqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIM5FTPTB1nK4gXIBLuKtcDHmLbKhsWpyXKgWy1fAYOf0DZEqCEqF9ns7RwihS1bFM9%2BSDXYY0CmIqutWQhK5asoL8jbJZ39%2FJ2eai2SoxTlg3PhjMpNNSUfPFgauwX6vt%2FoeK9VnB1Hmqg6bCNA62qIJPnlTONluGngv604Y6CnYL9Se%2B%2BjgOpqhqmIOX9KlzGAoRM0Ci%2BrWGdELH8Q66bSHmapdLHPWMoGBEj%2BeruK3oCs%2BDaUQ1aE%2FEQ8R5PgqLM3Pq6DrZV9PlFixmkikk8SpDcsFEiT0Zw0gsy2qPz3z3BHAEuG64GguAhIs5FvYP7HbdpPv7rQz4QSDXgN3SIbVD0A4kcV1iNQpZyiw2rmdxuUWIk46d%2FT0u%2B7j9yAdfpDuPVKPDHJD35k0pB6VLe7RtlSwwvcDUa7LL6FJxvOPpupIMPSy51BJl9%2Bf8022a6pcy263zeRDGJjALAc6brW%2BvQoDUu%2FQP%2BdxwOLZvXCyyGJp2%2BK86jg8qU%2FLWZ4DVeR3bIO1n7Fw%2B53iFlBIMatC3ZSLlV1J7dSDCk74u6OWvql%2Brvb6q%2Bj8NHQK6luFckQV%2B9okMhTYuNniW3sHS8rjyNrrGhP8vMtxMzink9EL%2FmU0Oxusg2wmaXCDfIKpDDmspvZQv8MJ%2F%2FkIsGOqYBaz2hfRV48KDU0Mx0UomuXdEWK6oszm51EnI%2FeSepVmINgIWWggB7gENawN0rgfpMSIqQjB%2BpErtoDw1jNWaknZlAG9GLkCZ49lNHNirjr7iPk7LouunUzSZjaag8Yc19L8BAWjyLZnHXpqUZQRBSoqOcAoct3F46M7AzK2ewXHmh7aKY3cfAQTu9yVTJd2CDpuLtlyUDUa37BJ8%2F84puzgJS34jmeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=d1728a5b3468781803884f77b0353098fb59ba49ab8569c14f5b17ed1e94d83b"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"shopify","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1949349,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"@jelmer Thanks for taking the time to improve your proof of concept.
