This vulnerability is present on the recipient-parameter which is used to specify destination email address of the email. \n\nThis recipient-parameter is normally not used on the first page of the email-flow, however by manually injecting it to the POST-request we can introduce an email address which will be placed on the resulting HTML-page as unsanitized value.\n\nAs the same functionality lacks any CSRF-protection, a CSRF-page can be crafted which will trigger the reflected XSS vulnerability when opened.\n\n**Impact:**\nThe vulnerability can be used at least to do the following:\n- Create open redirects via javascript.\n- Read all cookies that are scoped to lahitapiola-domain instead of the subdomain.\n- Read cookies of the secure-subdomain.\n- Maybe something else but I'm too tired to think and will post a comment if anything new pops up.\n\n## Browsers / Apps Verified In:\n\n  * Firefox\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1.

In this example, the page content is replaced so that it looks like a valid login page: F261946. \nThis replaced content however is simply still the original message-page with some elements hidden and some renamed. The sender-address is automatically set to the attacker's email and hidden. The recipient-address is set to non-existing Lahitapiola-email address and hidden. The subject-field is renamed to \"Kayttajanimi\" and the message-field is renamed to \"Salasana\". The attachment-section is hidden. \n\nNow when the victim tries to log in by filling the fields with own credentials and clicking the send-button, a message is sent to the non-existing Lahitapiola-email address which results in the message being bounced back to the sender who is the attacker in our case. Now when the attacker gets the email and reads it, the username and password of the victim are shown in the mail as \"subject\" and \"body\" of the undelivered message: F261950\n\nTL;DR: With some social engineering, sensitive user data can be delivered to the attacker with the messaging system. \n\n\n[1] Soc Eng CSRF Poc:\n\n```\n\u003chtml\u003e\n  \u003c!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite

By using a reflected XSS (due to missing validation) combined with a CSRF the reporter could create open redirects (via javascript), was able to read all present lahitapiola.fi cookies as well as cookies from the the secure-subdomain. Finally the reporter showed how to perform a complete redress of the UI and fooling the user to submit login-information and sending that login information back to the reporter himself as an error message.

Details about the fix are not disclosed. \n\n##Reasoning\n\nThe reported case was valid and within the scope of the bug bounty program. The root cause was not severe or complicated from a technical point of view. However, the found flaw enabled quite a bit of different approaches to do harm. The bounty is not based directly on the weakness, but rather on the business impact as well clever thinking.","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false,"attachments":[],"user":{"id":60017,"username":"localtapiola-thomas","name":"localtapiola-thomas","bio":"LocalTapiola Bug Bounty Coordinator - @tsmalmbe","cleared":false,"website":"http://www.lahitapiola.fi","location":"Espoo, Finland","created_at":"2016-03-09T13:58:17.117Z","url":"https://hackerone.com/localtapiola-thomas","anc_triager":false,"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false,"user_type":"legacy","profile_picture_urls":{"small":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/060/017/8cccb6dc22038468aec723dab1945e7df637da6b_original.png/43e4513b9104ea0d68c9c096cea374ba8440dde3e027af5465c8771e8839a67c","medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/060/017/8cccb6dc22038468aec723dab1945e7df637da6b_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c","xtralarge":"https://hackerone.com/rails/active_storage/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcWtrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ef0702cef87b20f1437c9a717c8b44719b380f58/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MY21WemFYcGxTU0lOTWpZd2VESTJNRDRHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--7e37b612eb3c91a96f98ad01ca9fbe53cab870dd/hackerone-userlogo.png"}}},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
