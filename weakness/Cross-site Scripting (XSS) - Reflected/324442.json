I did some code review and it seems that a file on the theme contains various problems:\n- The following admin URL can be accessed without being logged in: https://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/wp-content/themes/bbe/bbe-engine/assets/actions/bbe_open_htmleditor_popup.php\n- The above page uses \"value\" GET-parameter and fails to sanitize the content.\n\nBy combining the above problems, an attacker can craft a URL which triggers an cross-site scripting attack on any user (unauthenticated/authenticated) who opens the URL crafted by the attacker.\n\n**Impact:**\n* Make admin-user run malicious javascript which will then be used to access other WP-Admin functionalities --\u003e Remote code execution --\u003e Possibly piivoting to other hosts.\n* Make other users run malicious javascript.\n* Show spoofed content which can be used in social engineering attacks (such as fake login pages, fake invoices, face contact details, fake announcements etc.).\n\n## Browsers / Apps Verified In:\n\n  * Firefox\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1.

Then use this RCE to serve malicious content on domain and scan possible internal hosts etc.\n- Make the users of myynti.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi leak their credentials via some social engineering. See the URL [1] and F271740 for example. In this example attack, the malicious URL loads an iframe from my website which looks exactly like the login-form of [myynti.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi](myynti.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi). When the form is used, it will post user's credentials to my server.\n- Show spoofed content to anonymous users.
