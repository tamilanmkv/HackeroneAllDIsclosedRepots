This is a premium feature only allowed at Starter or higher. (https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/merge_requests/merge_request_approvals)\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Set your own username as \"\u003cimg src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)\u003e foo / bar\"\n  1. Make yourself have at least Master access to a project\n  1. Under Project Settings -\u003e General -\u003e Merge Request Settings,click the \"Merge request approvals\" checkbox\n  1. Select the user dropdown input for selecting eligible users to approve merge requests\n  1. Notice that the onerror attribute from the username renders.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\nMore information can be provided upon request.\n\n## Suggested Remediation\n\nLike the previous report I submitted, it is due to improper sanitization in a JS file.  I believe this is the offending line: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/ee/app/assets/javascripts/approvers_select.js#L134\n\n## Impact\n\nThe security impact is the same as any typical persistent xss.\n\nThe hacker selected the **Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored** weakness. This vulnerability type requires contextual information from the hacker.
