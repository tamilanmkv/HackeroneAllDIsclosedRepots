As a result of a misconfiguration - end user / attacker able to see content of the folders with systemically important files.\n\nImpact::\nExposing the contents of a directory can lead to an attacker gaining access to source code or providing useful information for the attacker to devise exploits, such as creation times of files or any information that may be encoded in file names. The directory listing may also compromise private or confidential data.\n\n\nAnother Bug is here \n\n1.https://download.nextcloud.com/server/daily/\n\n2. https://download.nextcloud.com/server/daily/latest.tar.bz2.asc\n\u0026 poc\u003e\u003e\n\n{F100082}\n\n\n\n{F100083}\n\n\nImpact::\n\n1.Practical Attacks on PGP\n\nNo data security implementation can ever be completely safeguarded from the \nattacks of an adversary. PGP like most cryptographic and security applications \ncan be circumvented in a variety\n of ways. This section will cover several of the \npractical attacks (both technical and non-technical) on Pretty Good Privacy that \ndo not involve cryptanalysis or any attack on the cryptosystem protocols, but \ninstead the implementation of PGP on a data system\n\n2.Pass-phrase and Private Key File Compromises\n\nOne of the most common ways for an attacker to compromise the security of \nPGP on a system is to obtain another user’s pass\n-\nphrase and/or private key \nfile. If an attacker has access to the pass phrase and \nsecret key file they can \nread the compromised user’s encrypted messages and make signatures using \nthat user’s private key. This weakness is not just specific to PGP; this is a \ntypical weakness found in most password/pass-phrase authentication \ncryptosystems. Users may select easily guessed pass-phrases or may store \ntheir private key in a location where someone with malicious intent may access \nit.  \nAn attacker may also use a tool or utility that will try to obtain a user’s pass \nphrase from the local workstation. Brute force or dictionary attack utilities such \nas PGPCrack or PGPpass are designed to crack PGP encrypted files. The \nattacker may also use a keyboard logger utility that can capture the keystrokes \nof an unsuspecting user and save it to a designated location where they can then retrieve the user’s revealed plaintext pass-phrase. \n\n3.Public Key Tampering\n\nIn a public key cryptosystem, the public keys of users should be distributed so all have the components necessary to securely communicate and exchange information with each other. A crucial component in this system is the fact that users must be able to trust that a public key really belongs to whom it appears to belong to. This particular vulnerability is quite important to be aware of,many novices and even IT professionals may fall victim to trusting the tampered public key of an impostor. Once a user encrypts a document or message with the tampered public key and sends it, the impostor will be able to decrypt and read the contents. The user may have just unintentionally disclosed sensitive \npersonal or proprietary company information. PGP users should make certain that they only trust the public key of someone if they have got it directly from its owner, or someone the user directly trusts has \nsigned the public key of the new user.\n\n4.Trojan Horse Attacks\n\nTrojan horse attacks pose one of the most serious threats to application \nsecurity today. A Trojan horse is a seemingly harmless program that contains \nmalicious code, which may\n infect a users PGP application or their operating \nsystem subverting the security of both. An attacker could use this code to \ncapture a user’s plaintext messages, or to obtain the user’s pass-phrase or private key. \n\n\nand so many :)\n\nThanks sir :)
