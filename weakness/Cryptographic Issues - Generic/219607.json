However, I think specifically in this case:\n\n1) CRAM-MD5 has a unique random challenge for every authentication request, which is used to generate the final HMAC-MD5 based responses that are being compared. So this means that the final responses are practically two random 256bit values being compared. The memcmp() timing attack won't tell anything else beyond \"matches\" vs \"doesn't match\", which will be obvious anyway. On the next authentication attempt it's comparing again two different values. So it's not possible to incrementally attempt to determine the password using a timing attack.\n\n2) Dovecot doesn't immediately return failure to client when an authentication fails. Instead, it queues the failure and every 2 seconds it sends out all the pending auth failures. This already makes the timing attacks much more difficult. I guess it might make some sense to add a bit of further randomness to use 2s +- 100ms or something, although as described elsewhere it doesn't fully prevent timing attack issues, only makes them somewhat more difficult. Still, could be worth it.\n\nIf we were talking about plaintext authentication against a plaintext password then yes, a timing attack could be possible against that, although I think pretty unlikely to be successful on a real system. Still, that's something that we could fix. Quick googling suggests double-hmac comparisons with a random key.\n\nThere are probably various timing attacks against checking whether a username exists or not, but preventing those is likely not practical.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-04-08T21:23:42.143Z","updated_at":"2017-04-08T21:23:42.143Z","actor":{"username":"tss","cleared":false,"url":"/tss","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"open-xchange","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1600344,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @tss,\n\n\u003e 1) CRAM-MD5 has a unique random challenge for every authentication request, which is used to generate the final HMAC-MD5 based responses that are being compared.
