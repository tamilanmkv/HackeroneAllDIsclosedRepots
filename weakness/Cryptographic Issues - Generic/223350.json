All you can do on the server side is to avoid letting unaware clients put themselves in a BEAST-vulnerable position. \n\nHowever, modern clients (Web browsers) are not vulnerable to BEAST anyway:\nClients use record splitting (usually 1/n-1) as a countermeasure. BEAST requires the hostile in-browser code (in Java or Javascript) to be able to send requests to the target site with arbitrary byte values; no method for doing that is currently known.\n\nA client that is still vulnerable to BEAST is a client that has not been updated for several years, which means that it already has bigger problems. A more general solution is to use TLS 1.1 or 1.2, which are not vulnerable to that specific attack. However, even when clients support such protocols, they also tend to indulge in unbridled reconnections that make them vulnerable to protocol downgrade attacks.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-04-24T12:03:44.666Z","updated_at":"2017-04-24T12:03:44.666Z","actor":{"username":"mrr3boot","cleared":false,"url":"/mrr3boot","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"weblate","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1630669,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"The server side solution blocks many users from Windows 7, older Androids and probably some other minor browsers.
