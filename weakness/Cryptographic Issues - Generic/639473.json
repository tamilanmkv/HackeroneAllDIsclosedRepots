The principle is actually extremely simple: The keyservers operate on an \"append only\" principle, and everyone can add new signatures to an existing key. So one can make a key practically unusable by adding lots of signatures.\n\nMore background:\nhttps://dkg.fifthhorseman.net/blog/openpgp-certificate-flooding.html\nhttps://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f\n\nAn \"expoit\" has also been published, but this is more or less trivial:\nhttps://gist.github.com/yegortimoshenko/8d57c7892d4bcd50d11e69f71b1f80bf\n\nAn attacker can poison the release key . This will likely either lead to the key becoming unimportable or gpg becoming unusable or extremely slow.\n\nAttack 2: Key ID collission\n====================\n\nThe above command fetches the key via its 64 bit key id over an unauthenticated connection.\nThe shortened 64 bit key ids aren't safe from collisions, an attacker can create a different key with the same 64 bit key id (though this requires a large amount of computing power, but it's feasible). Only the full 160 bit key ids are safe.\n\nTherefore a network/mitm attacker can serve a user a bad key with the same key id and then a signed repository with rogue packages.\n\n\nSolution\n======\n\nTo avoid both scenarios I recommend fetching the key from a secure (HTTPS) place under your control. This is also what Debian recommends:\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty\n\n## Impact\n\nMake installation instructions unusable due to poisoned key or execute malicious code as a network attacker during installation.","weakness":{"id":32,"name":"Cryptographic Issues - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-02-20T13:30:43.526Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-51759810.101224154,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":9,"voters":["0xelkomy","m7mdharoun","exception","mheranco","s1lv3rb4ck","root_hunterho","parasiteop","markbland","ospf"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5297246,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @hanno,\n\nThis report is for the repo setup instructions for mirrors here?\n\nhttps://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/#mirror=nxtHost\u0026distro=Debian","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-07-11T06:40:38.617Z","updated_at":"2019-07-11T06:40:38.617Z","actor":{"username":"teodor","cleared":false,"url":"/teodor","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mariadb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5298410,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Yes, exactly.
