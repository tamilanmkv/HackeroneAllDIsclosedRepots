The numbers are not predictable, due to the use of [`random_int`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-int.php).\n\nMost notably the [`OC\\Security\\Crypto::encrypt`](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/92692cdd7ab42453b38f1ba684649c86f2d488c0/lib/private/Security/Crypto.php#L91) method uses an [IV](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/92692cdd7ab42453b38f1ba684649c86f2d488c0/lib/private/Security/Crypto.php#L97) with a [length of 16 bytes](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/92692cdd7ab42453b38f1ba684649c86f2d488c0/lib/private/Security/Crypto.php#L51). It is chosen randomly via `OC\\Security\\SecureRandom::generate` with the default character set. There are 256 possible bytes, but in this case it is *actually* 64 bytes. The permutations is 64^16 (instead of 256^16), which equates to a 12-byte, or 96-bit IV (instead of the expected 16-byte, or 128-bit IV). __Use raw bytes when doing cryptographic operations, via [`random_bytes`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.random-bytes.php).__\n\nDo not use `OC\\Security\\Crypto::generate` for cryptographic keys.\n\n\n### Cache Timing Attacks\n\nIt is *potentially* vulnerable to [cache timing attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack) because the secret number is used as an index to look up a byte value in string. [Read more about cache-timing attacks here](https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2014/11/its-all-about-time.html#Other-Types-Of-Timing-Attacks-Index-Lookup).\n\n## Impact\n\n1. Reduced permutations increase the chances of IV re-use (which can destroy confidentially), and bring encryption key strength down (chances are still too low with a 256-bit encryption key).\n\n2. If the complex cache timing attack vector exists, and is abused: it is possible to determine secret values generated with `OC\\Security\\SecureRandom::generate`.","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":32,"name":"Cryptographic Issues - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-10-28T09:13:46.939Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-30090048.465366147,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":9,"voters":["ali","demonia","haxxman19xx","shadowhare","helphen","jaimin07","lynn-stephenson","greyhat412","bl4krat"],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":13,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"nextcloud/server","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":7705359,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us!\n\nOur security team will take a look at this issue as soon as possible.
