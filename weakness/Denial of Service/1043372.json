This happens when you visit a corrupted bounty table of a target program.\n\nI didn't figure out yet how this issue happened but I am reporting it now immediately because it affects all hackers who view the bounty table of  the target affected program.\n\n**Description:**\nThe issue happened with me when I was clicking on a notification telling that `Clario has updated their bounty table`.\nSo I clicked on it to see the updated bounty table and suddenly my browser tab crashed and a message showed telling `Error code: Out Of Memory`.\nI tried it from two hackerone accounts and they results with the same issue.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Navigate to the notification: https://hackerone.com/clario/bounty_table_versions?nid=115515717\u0026utm_campaign=user_652675\u0026utm_content=team_url\u0026utm_medium=email\u0026utm_source=bounty_table_update\n2. You will not be able to click on any button (Ex: profile or Inbox).\n3.  After short while, Browser will crash.\n\n### Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)\nGoogle Chrome.\n\n### Optional: Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)\nPlease see the attached image and quick video PoC\n\n██████████\n\n{F1093466}\n\n### Optional: Did you use [recon data made available by HackerOne](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/helpful-recon-data) to find this vulnerability?\n\nno\n\n## Impact\n\nDenial Of Service (Out Of Memory) - Crashing whole Browser (happened with me) and loading up computer resources (CPU and RAM).\n\nKind

And will completely crash browsers like Firefox.\n- Will load the CPU to the maximum usage and this may lead to serious damages for low-medium specs computers (heat, crash) if the attack took some time.\n- The attack doesn't block any mission-critical interactions nor leads to data loss.\n\nTaking the above points in consideration and assessing the severity with CVSS I came up with Medium 4.3 impact.\n- The attack requires User Interaction (clicking on the affected Url).\n- It cause low damages on Availability section as mentioned in the above points like cause crashing, warming and loading CPU.\n\n{F1095210}\n\nNow I believe that Medium impact now makes more sense.
