Later that config is used to generate new CSS rules:\n\n```\n  let userStyles = '';\n  // user provided theme CSS\n  if (cnf.themeCSS !== undefined) {\n    userStyles += `\\n${cnf.themeCSS}`;\n  }\n  // user provided theme CSS\n  if (cnf.fontFamily !== undefined) {\n    userStyles += `\\n:root { --mermaid-font-family: ${cnf.fontFamily}}`;\n  }\n  // user provided theme CSS\n  if (cnf.altFontFamily !== undefined) {\n    userStyles += `\\n:root { --mermaid-alt-font-family: ${cnf.altFontFamily}}`;\n  }\n```\n\n## Vulnerability description\n\nThe issue is that directive JSON_OBJECT is lacking proper sanitization which means we can specify `__proto__` attribute to overwrite Object prototype.\n\nFor example, if we use following payload, it will add attribute `polluted` to every new object in the application:\n```\n%%{init: { '__proto__': {'polluted': 'asdf'}} }%%\nsequenceDiagram\nAlice-\u003e\u003eBob: Hi Bob\nBob-\u003e\u003eAlice: Hi Alice\n```\n\nI have tried to use it to overwrite config values or other attributes to achieve XSS, but since a new attribute will be accessible in every object, it just breaks the application. \n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create an issue in any repository\n2. Create mermaid diagram with following payload:\n```\n%%{init: { '__proto__': {'polluted': 'asdf'}} }%%\nsequenceDiagram\nAlice-\u003e\u003eBob: Hi Bob\nBob-\u003e\u003eAlice: Hi Alice\n```\n\n3. Save the issue. Now when you open this page and click anywhere, you will see that nothing works. In Developer Console you can see a lot of exceptions that are triggered by a polluted prototype.\n\n## PoC\nOpen https://gitlab.com/bugbountyuser1/dos/-/issues/1/\nYou will see that you can't comment or perform any action except clicking on the left sidebar links.\n\n{F1200063}\n\n## What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\nMermaid allows setting `__proto__` attribute in the directive which leads to DOS via prototype pollution.\n\n## What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nMermaid doesn't allow` __proto__` attributed to being set in the directive and merged with the config. \n\n## Output of checks\n\nThis vulnerability was tested on gitlab.com. On a local Gitlab instance with a newer version(same as gitlab.com) of Mermaid, it works too.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker who can add Mermaid diagram to the page will make this page broken. Users will not be able to add comments, edit comments, etc.","bounty_amount":"3000.0","formatted_bounty":"$3,000","weakness":{"id":62,"name":"Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Stored"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":1200063,"file_name":"2021-02-18_11-03.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fu11cgg6p5ljpmth60r7ciervn87?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%222021-02-18_11-03.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%272021-02-18_11-03.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQRJF6VFL6%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T132458Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCID1So1KYRjOmBFJqLsqO1j9SSUCF9kJ%2FHqahOyDLmrnJAiAr2q5Z8bAgCyaCmyDSz7xwtmUTDOoz04myJOluBHRCeyqDBAju%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMvFUMWX6P00RsVarQKtcDflFFNScU3coA1YbnKy4lPXtwGDNsJcqhfcCTaePuAuK6nWvl5xRbjzjOBPvBHaTAnb2Iw%2B6Jdj2uyjmRMn%2F5%2F5AzD5di2wWOcC0am9iLaFmORG4VIVXTc8aAiiwqjNAu7dH2hTUNL9bwPzYUBq3%2FjwvNZUM%2FmpdXfugOwAP%2FP3w9e9PqozA16XzrwGIunimlg58HKZfOM0xp%2FESLFXRHAssX6DaYqQQyV5%2F0triAQeOx328GOBUjfGTiAl1aoS1J0%2FqN%2BmywXW%2FqqkEfAQ2n2f18dX2dkbwMnyQ4F47zR6jJw3CdBkeCPRDbbhcu8YGu2%2F%2BzzM9B4uguhR76M3KYB3dr919eRp%2F%2BcOfUxc8TC3gXMmp1jh0ywwC27sBrzUgZdh%2B2g4artPxRaRZPHbQvC%2F1OZ0MxZYsQmEItbUc65WqfO6PSdLbymEFDMyN5ona14j%2BaQHfp1MWNaO02I2WPYO5mZIsPuHjCO5MYUldcsrZMP7pydKVo87gkO2fPB2orxw1RGazxVwGy5R2PDIV7HsKH4KSOqhGLTTYcSjZvxzmTWIy013yrXhU3CEdFUoB7QifSN1bUli2cMIaUe7sr75onhlaNnQxqLv%2By7jqQ9RiOHvcMM4XIMInwkIsGOqYBzgDHFUI%2FtkToYUBHsGsXyI9vGkS81IUV4PSjgSfvCFIGR%2BPjro3EYi30Oc%2FQZijhik3H1oI82Vno5zo%2BVnueR7%2BkGCloKvMkJAe%2F77e%2BPPRDClquvRG9ERm7ELsd6WvljYOJTmuP4pWPW%2B2d%2BQu26lThNein0I5abJKiu%2FYvnXDmBeYAgLMwbyg9Lq3qT5qMKsr3i1aOgHcGHtYldnzNcLqwaNJYhw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=4e88d4f65bf98b1f1a42a82032c9cc43ec1a8d6cb9da333c02a11d4505ec702e","file_size":183693,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":44,"voters":["obsesif","run_win","fqdn","bombon","ali","iambouali","imranhudaa","naategh","khizer47","h4x0r_dz","and 34 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18138,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"gitlab.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10706962,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @taraszelyk,\n\nThank you for submitting this report!
