It's not a dos in the traditional sense of using up tons of bandwidth, but if It is the bounty that's causing the hang up I believe it's because it's trying to use an excessive amount of memory.  If that's the case, it would potentially allow for new bugs to be found/exploited during an attack. \n\nIf I didn't use the same picture for the team I submitted, then I will have to wait until I get home to send a new one.
