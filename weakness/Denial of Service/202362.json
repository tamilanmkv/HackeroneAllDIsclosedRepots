This bug is not triggerable in the sandbox, because it does not use the Random class, but it is triggerable in mruby with the following piece of code:\n\n```ruby\n$r = Random.new\na = Object.new\ndef a.to_int\n    $r.rand\nend\n\n$r.initialize a\n```\nThe data pointer of $r is set to NULL before parsing arguments in `mrb_random_init`. The srand() call will try to dereference it to get the mt_state and this results in a crash. \n\nThe problem lies in `mrbgems/mruby-random/src/random.c` and is similar to  #182274:\n```c\n128   t = (mt_state*)DATA_PTR(self);\n129   if (t) {\n130      mrb_free(mrb, t);\n131   }\n132   mrb_data_init(self, NULL, \u0026mt_state_type);\n133   \n134   t = (mt_state *)mrb_malloc(mrb, sizeof(mt_state));\n135   t-\u003emti = N + 1;\n136   \n137   seed = get_opt(mrb);        /* Move this up before line 127 */\n```\n\nPlease let me know if you are explicitly just looking for bugs affecting the sandbox, so I won't submit invalid reports.
