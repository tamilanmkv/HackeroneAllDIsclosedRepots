But the problem here is the condition check before reading the file to the variable:\n\nFile: https://github.com/gratipay/gip.rocks/blob/master/www/v1.spt\n\n```python\nif int(request.headers['Content-Length']) \u003e 256 * 1024:\n    raise Response(413)\n\nimage_type = request.headers['Content-Type']\nif image_type not in ('image/png', 'image/jpeg'):\n    raise Response(415)\n\n# Load the image.\nfp = StringIO(request.raw_body)\nfp.seek(0)\nimage = Image.open(fp)\n\n```\n\nHere you can see that you are calculating the length of the incoming file from the `content-length` HTTP header and if it is less than `256 * 1024`, you will accept the request. But this is not a correct way to check size of the incoming file.\n\n## POC:\n\n1) Initiate a system wide proxy with burp suite\n\n2) Try to send a curl request with a huge file and see the request in curl\n\n3) The content length will be obviously greater than the max value application accepts but modify the `content-length` header to a value which is less than `256 * 1024`.\n\n4) Forward the request and you can see that the server will read the files to a variable and if the file is large enough, this is more than enough to DOS the server.\n\nNow since this deals with DOS, I haven't actually tried out this attack but we can easily confirm this from the source code that this can be bypassed in the way I explained above. I also tried deploying locally but I had a hard time making the software run locally and I don't have enough free time to debug what is happening.\n\nBut I think the bug is very clear from the source code itself, which is why I really didn't test it but thought to report it.\n\n## Mitigation:\n\nPutting your trust on HTTP headers may not be a good idea. But I am not really sure what is a solid method to find the proper length of the string in this case.","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial of Service"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-04-28T17:36:37.688Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-140559932.88532326,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":11,"voters":["delimitry","inhibitor181","edoverflow","eveeez","khizer47","linkks","bb00x","a0xnirudh","spetr0x","tastic-toaster","and 1 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","score":7.5,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"none","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1462658,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi,\n\nThank you for your report, the receipt of which we herewith confirm.

Any other software we publish (in Github)` and also in your domains section you have added this: `github.com/gratipay`. The above 2 rules means that the the domain `gip.rocks` is in the program (or atleast as a participant in your bug bounty program, that's what I understood).\n\n\u003eThat aside, I'd want to look at whether slicing request.raw_body does in fact prevent the full request body from being loaded into memory.

In order for a proper fix, it has to deal with the underlying `Aspen/Pando`. \n\nBut don't you think this should be something that should be fixed ? I mean the issue should indeed gets fixed IMHO. I don't think closing this without having a solution for this is a good idea.\n\nAnother thing I thought about is that,  is there is a way we can restrict the memory usage by python to a maximum limit ? I haven't done something like this before myself but there exist some [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30269238/limit-memory-usage) questions on the same.  For a temporary protection of your server `gip.rocks` you can try to limit the process memory space for python ? (This was the only alternative I can think of so that the server can be protected without dealing deep into `aspen`).\n\nLet me know what your team thinks about this.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-02-17T04:44:41.781Z","updated_at":"2017-02-17T04:44:41.781Z","actor":{"username":"a0xnirudh","cleared":false,"url":"/a0xnirudh","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/035/891/b9be8d32dadcaa814c6bf85eceef7fdf9fa38f41_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1491174,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi @a0xnirudh,\n\nSorry for all the confusion!
