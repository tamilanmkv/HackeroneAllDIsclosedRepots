Short summary\nHi, I noticed that the following report has been fixed and closed, however the bug has reappeared in different parameters: https://hackerone.com/reports/204208\n\n# Basic report information\n\n**Summary:**\nIt is possible to generate a simple request which creates a high cpu/bandwidth consumption from the server by abusing the captcha servlet\n\n**Description:**\nBy sending a specially crafted request and changing the height/width and minWordSize and maxWordSize parameters in the captcha form it is possible to consume large amount of cpu/memory and bandwidth.\n\n**Domain:**\nhttp://viestinta.lahitapiola.fi/\n\n# Browsers / Apps Verified In:\n\nChrome / CURL\n\n# Steps To Reproduce:\n\n* Send a request to the following url:  https://viestinta.lahitapiola.fi/nms/jsp/captcha.jsp?captchaID=@vq-ooKP6OECsEZDMwxvQGBMqfP81em45ejwud1pg7vc=\u0026width=10000\u0026height=100000\u0026minWordSize=20000\u0026maxWordSize=200000000 and notice that the server is trying to generate the image, however it doesn't respond as it takes tons of resources to generate such image.\n\n# Remarks\n\nIn the scope of testing I saw that denial of service is out of scope, This attack is more applicative and doesn't use distributed denial of service methods and I think it is important for you to fix this although it is not in scope.\n\n","bounty_amount":"315.0","formatted_bounty":"$315","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial of
