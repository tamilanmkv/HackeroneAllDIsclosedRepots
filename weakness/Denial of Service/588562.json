Also OCUtils.dll and OCUtils_x64.dll library which is delivered with Nextclound Windows installer was included in the attachment.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Launch tests.exe (see attachment) or compile the attached VS2017 solution and launch the resulted executable\n2. Make sure OCUtil_x64 library is in the System library path\n3.

leaks have two common and sometimes overlapping causes:\n\n- Error conditions and other exceptional circumstances.\n\n- Confusion over which part of the program is responsible for freeing the memory.\n\nIn this case, the memory allocated in FileUtil.cpp at line 42 is not always freed or returned by the function.\n\nMost memory leaks result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a memory leak, the attacker may be able to launch a denial of service attack (by crashing the program) or take advantage of other unexpected program behavior resulting from a low memory condition \n\nThe function IsChildFile(const wchar_t* rootFolder, const wchar_t* file) is part of OCUtil.dll library which is delivered with Nextcloud Windows installer and it is loaded in explorer.exe process in order to provide context menu functionalities. \nBy using the context menu functionality multiple times, explorer.exe could pottentialy run out of memory.","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":48,"name":"Denial of
