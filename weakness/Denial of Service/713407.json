Then i observed the same behaviour at everyplace where my profile picture was being reflected for example the programs thanks section, hacktivity section or even the directory section. This leads to site wide Denial of Service that will deny all the users from performing any actions. \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Login and visit edit profile page. \n2. Select a normal profile picture and click `Update Profile` button\n3. Intercept this Request and change the filename to `+` by editing the request as shown in  ██████████\n4. Turn off the intercept button and the refresh the update page.\n5. Notice that it wont load. \nNow the similar behaviour can be observed at every place where your profile picture is shown.  \n\n### Optional: Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)\n\n * █████\n\n### Optional: Did you use [recon data made available by HackerOne](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/helpful-recon-data) to find this vulnerability?\n\nno\n\n## Impact\n\nApplication wide denial of service.

And if we visit it manually, we get a 404 error.\n###How can someone weaponize it?\nSo when we visit a program's profile page or thanks page, profile of top 5 hackers as well as all the others who have successfully closed a report with that program can be seen respectively. This profile includes their username as well as profile picture.A graphql request is sent to fetch these details. Now suppose a malicious actor have followed the trick mentioned in the ATTACK section and exists in a programs hall of fame or is a one of the top 5 hackers, when the same graphql request is sent to fetch the details, it responds with a 500 error because the profile picture of malicious actor doesn't exists as mentioned above. This leads to a Denial of service.      \n##Steps To Reproduce\nTo reproduce this attack, certain conditions must be met.-\n* You exist in a hall of fame of any public program OR are in the top 5 (Which increases the impact as no one would be able to submit a report)\n* You have a recently closed a report with a public program(it will DOSes the while hacktivity section)\n* OR there is any other place where a users's profile picture is shown/reflected.\n\n###Take the following steps to execute the attack :-\n1. Login and visit `edit profile` section\n2. Upload any normal image and click `upload profile button`\n3. Intercept this request, edit the filename to `+` and then forward the edited request.\n4. Now in incognito tab, visit your profile page. Notice that it gives  500 error.(F607324)\n5. , visit the thanks page of a program where you exist in their hall of fame.\n6. Notice that the page wont load.( Behind the scene at F607317. Notice the 500 errors from the graphql requests)\n7. Now if you have recently closed a report with a public program, maybe you wont be able to see the hacktivity section too.(i haven't tested it since i have closed a report recently)\n\n##Impact\nSo basically this attack will impact any place where the attacker profile picture is being fetched or shown for example - his/her profile page, the program profile page(if the attacker exists in their top 5 list), the hacktivity section(i'm not sure about it since i couldn't test it), the programs thanks tab(again if he/she exists there)\nleading to A Denial Of Service Attack.\nIf you need additional proof, please let me know. :)\nAddtionally, i you need live demo, let me know.\nThanks and Regards,\n@ninetynine ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-10-14T14:06:19.857Z","updated_at":"2019-10-14T14:17:08.896Z","actor":{"username":"ninetynine","cleared":true,"url":"/ninetynine","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/LQ9n7MycfmGxqrJoWow9pUTN/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"attachments":[{"id":607324,"filename":"POC-1.png","type":"image/png","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/q1AoBa9vRmBFPfRTqYZesSbw?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22POC-1.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27POC-1.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ5B5ZLR7W%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151940Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDznwDn3DlLBhpUQR2HsgV%2FXq95UR4rgunTAtaALtJfOwIhAPs6S1Tcddn1VigtqMJZu1ze7EJhUESTAidgv9nNGvTkKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwZmyQg19q82eNvWTYq1wPVa9iL33aSnxoe9uhB7r2aVM0UjDJv7L7h4wpacx0zTD7Cg8zZaNStfUkAQ4PRdT1iVaYXFqr3oEtcRoGLKhag7I7AYV4CfabHIx%2FljtUdbse7EzqrV%2BLQvKbTG6z1i6zNoig4BjAmqV%2BbJNhSJroBCOPElku0SEqEghibUoxjbjpR4CBXjTIJwAUpnCgLLy91sSgp9KNeTgb1AkQk9PEiYIt%2BjjRn7YHGTo0lsLEhUWc0hsx6VLMRCiSyU6pMLzMGyTS6q7VECFtTn5Z0xG6cXCTKHB3pYQ1zLLYN8ml68bLOIBj9DG3soHxXVeXkifKnxu13VQyp3%2Fs7gxFDt1C7HjJ71usGGrh%2BfYBJJFBMGndfS1DoK%2Bopk8YhA2hlX3szEJmyZfm0KUVaG%2FoWbCJlR3fqXIBJ1cKXRlMooUSiLaTSXt07k2ZqF9w0HUl1IdVQzbNbJBH%2BnkPxpioMdR%2BthDqTyEJ4NZO1WuIxKWGZYyMyXsZaWNopcb1ntUTbg6h9jL8PBR4KRpM%2FHAsw70cht3GV%2BEt83AJHQMRTRifsEIkEWjFR47llnjXkbbepxcng%2ByfEEKZRp237bvaIzCz%2FOBASo1zhQretKmelA0U4%2BEADJwrI3hIwr4yRiwY6pAEjctaIC5qKHFIiVu1bdWXuftBXGyVKZyt2TIP%2B2%2FEEDUKSn7h674C0WnV7bDgpkWP3Jm2QA8%2B4oAW2qew892kEhCJxDwZz%2BXR81EJw6%2FG5A5FZJ8bUl63WLiuBkwA0Dx%2Bf%2FkeTcR6awW4gpgHN5q2%2B02FvrdW8HWnLO9b%2FdddTJiHpMjGB2dteCQWg1L0LIQ%2FyL7kCQpQu%2F5PLB76pfiUetgXbFQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=d372ff95007918a57abf4ae298a6ba4395fc95863c51d20c59a688421b73d431"},{"id":607317,"filename":"POC-2.PNG","type":"image/png","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/MfDQFdHWe5QmBag9vexLxv1E?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22POC-2.PNG%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27POC-2.PNG\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ5B5ZLR7W%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T151940Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJIMEYCIQDznwDn3DlLBhpUQR2HsgV%2FXq95UR4rgunTAtaALtJfOwIhAPs6S1Tcddn1VigtqMJZu1ze7EJhUESTAidgv9nNGvTkKoMECO%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEQAhoMMDEzNjE5Mjc0ODQ5IgwZmyQg19q82eNvWTYq1wPVa9iL33aSnxoe9uhB7r2aVM0UjDJv7L7h4wpacx0zTD7Cg8zZaNStfUkAQ4PRdT1iVaYXFqr3oEtcRoGLKhag7I7AYV4CfabHIx%2FljtUdbse7EzqrV%2BLQvKbTG6z1i6zNoig4BjAmqV%2BbJNhSJroBCOPElku0SEqEghibUoxjbjpR4CBXjTIJwAUpnCgLLy91sSgp9KNeTgb1AkQk9PEiYIt%2BjjRn7YHGTo0lsLEhUWc0hsx6VLMRCiSyU6pMLzMGyTS6q7VECFtTn5Z0xG6cXCTKHB3pYQ1zLLYN8ml68bLOIBj9DG3soHxXVeXkifKnxu13VQyp3%2Fs7gxFDt1C7HjJ71usGGrh%2BfYBJJFBMGndfS1DoK%2Bopk8YhA2hlX3szEJmyZfm0KUVaG%2FoWbCJlR3fqXIBJ1cKXRlMooUSiLaTSXt07k2ZqF9w0HUl1IdVQzbNbJBH%2BnkPxpioMdR%2BthDqTyEJ4NZO1WuIxKWGZYyMyXsZaWNopcb1ntUTbg6h9jL8PBR4KRpM%2FHAsw70cht3GV%2BEt83AJHQMRTRifsEIkEWjFR47llnjXkbbepxcng%2ByfEEKZRp237bvaIzCz%2FOBASo1zhQretKmelA0U4%2BEADJwrI3hIwr4yRiwY6pAEjctaIC5qKHFIiVu1bdWXuftBXGyVKZyt2TIP%2B2%2FEEDUKSn7h674C0WnV7bDgpkWP3Jm2QA8%2B4oAW2qew892kEhCJxDwZz%2BXR81EJw6%2FG5A5FZJ8bUl63WLiuBkwA0Dx%2Bf%2FkeTcR6awW4gpgHN5q2%2B02FvrdW8HWnLO9b%2FdddTJiHpMjGB2dteCQWg1L0LIQ%2FyL7kCQpQu%2F5PLB76pfiUetgXbFQ%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=1e093ecafb46ae5f1658181347db6cc2d2b3be8474c2f42df7826c5e49200a0c"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6040439,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey there, \nI have another scenario which would completely DOS the Directory section of hackerone.\n###Scenario:-\nLets us consider that a malicious actor have recently launched a public program on  hackerone.
