Since a valid phar file needs o be uploaded to the server (the extension doesn't matter) I upload the poc.jpg via the media uploader\n2. I begin the Import process with a valid CSV file\n3.  The importer asks if I am sure that I want to run the import on these files\n4. I confirm and modify the  POST parameter to my phar:// wrapper and deserialize the file\n5. The PHP code executes\n\nThe source of the vulnerability within the source code lies in the /woocommerce/includes/import/class-wc-product-csv-importer.php:\n\n```\n\tpublic function __construct( $file, $params = array() ) {\n\t\t$default_args = array(\n\t\t\t'start_pos'        =\u003e 0, // File pointer start.\n\t\t\t'end_pos'          =\u003e -1, // File pointer end.\n\t\t\t'lines'            =\u003e -1, // Max lines to read.\n\t\t\t'mapping'          =\u003e array(), // Column mapping. csv_heading =\u003e schema_heading.\n\t\t\t'parse'            =\u003e false, // Whether to sanitize and format data.\n\t\t\t'update_existing'  =\u003e false, // Whether to update existing items.\n\t\t\t'delimiter'        =\u003e ',', // CSV delimiter.\n\t\t\t'prevent_timeouts' =\u003e true, // Check memory and time usage and abort if reaching limit.\n\t\t\t'enclosure'        =\u003e '\"', // The character used to wrap text in the CSV.\n\t\t\t'escape'           =\u003e \"\\0\", // PHP uses '\\' as the default escape character. This is not RFC-4180 compliant. This disables the escape character.\n\t\t);\n\n\t\t$this-\u003eparams = wp_parse_args( $params, $default_args );\n\t\t$this-\u003efile   = $file;\n\n\t\tif ( isset( $this-\u003eparams['mapping']['from'], $this-\u003eparams['mapping']['to'] ) ) {\n\t\t\t$this-\u003eparams['mapping'] = array_combine( $this-\u003eparams['mapping']['from'], $this-\u003eparams['mapping']['to'] );\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t$this-\u003eread_file();\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Read file.\n\t */\n\tprotected function read_file() {\n\t\t$handle = fopen( $this-\u003efile, 'r' ); // @codingStandardsIgnoreLine.\n\n\t\tif ( false !== $handle ) {\n\t\t\t$this-\u003eraw_keys = version_compare( PHP_VERSION, '5.3', '\u003e=' ) ? fgetcsv( $handle, 0, $this-\u003eparams['delimiter'], $this-\u003eparams['enclosure'], $this-\u003eparams['escape'] ) : fgetcsv( $handle, 0, $this-\u003eparams['delimiter'], $this-\u003eparams['enclosure'] ); // @codingStandardsIgnoreLine\n\n...\n```\n\nAs can be seen, the constructor calls read_file, which in turn calls fopen without any checks, which leads to the deserialization of the Phar object.\n\nI recommend to check the file parameter and see if it actually is a CSV file before calling fopen on it.\n\nI have attached the poc.jpg that worked for my PHP version.\n\n## Impact\n\nI only displayed the contents of the /etc/passwd file in the PoC video. However, since I can execute arbitrary PHP code, a complete compromise of the WordPress installation is possible. If an attacker can gain access to a Shop manager account, he can easily and without restrictions take over the server.","bounty_amount":"350.0","formatted_bounty":"$350","weakness":{"id":52,"name":"Deserialization of Untrusted Data"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":340061,"file_name":"poc.jpg","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/340/061/0979cc385adeebe32a96dd6b225b073e1d9f4d13/poc.jpg?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22poc.jpg%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27poc.jpg\u0026response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ57JDOB6N%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T145626Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHcaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIEj%2FvPHmMbBPYj%2BEqI%2BytJ5vP%2BW1Gij3b1KCROLW2m2fAiAUI2BnkECXV9d7hwkeZDEOYP6soFW%2FVQ7MIgaTaOghmSqDBAjw%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMaJpXtlkzQ%2F0YHokTKtcDqr54hfj92oRcu2Uf5AYn5X1dcYZ2fUSGzbf8TlAKPi%2BieszVvrvHI%2FlmbHmgiT1EynvsarNndOfkF2FRqu00jKx0CkmuRzepTozsI%2FVM4zmVsulVco0%2FTcUTH7ncLq5w17UCDOGpnW6JGeAot2EMSfGI%2BXeXow9Po2gINOm1gQnayfBCxU0Glim8HMTLVSft15PsLBhoVz6MQjjs5LpN9XS8yUG%2FvTzXTgclJY%2F9kWPo7VUzvyGgDBwaQ1NS4mY%2FwZ0AT%2BbZ6JXbFSX9ET%2BsjMi2Xi4Iz%2BSZK9IqUkrM05KykgVZmm0Jj83i2n43f%2BohD1oputpWW5Uu1cAXNs%2F4CRB2hvvyPQb%2B2khSXC6sOQi3exb9EuT5FkfOJXRD2w2ObGvWHxM%2BDQNczFHMaUBsCSSNn2cKqA093ghnjQ0g83xgTV9SBPb0QjpItD1Tnt9%2Bri%2FBh8RNCTedm%2Bor7TU6AnBCa6N50D96ANJhWhGw8kKZQdvzW0b0yw%2FH0clJ9XBtHGp1ul88rpA7tUuIoM7z31gr%2FReHR4G0fbpI0Bw%2BzUst%2BenEZyU7QQChxDc0u9loqAHNkWSJ3vDfDAhU2gFvocid02DAX%2FlKRXns4oUAYN7obhQgZX31MK2XkYsGOqYBmhNgLXdsx%2F8OPaK%2FmcpHbqK%2FVdgD3s09C%2FMBcjoeNruPiR%2B0%2FIpdgtcxNhaPoR0zb6re%2ByXh4v3hr2D2Z0%2BZCE4KiobLnf4PqE9a5czy2i5ctMeGIPCspubSRwCRBRORrnkT6%2FEocUc5PNqombEgctkvB80CoCyMfXpFqtIL0ne7x%2B%2B6lVkpXfm14Eb3XaRg7qWG7XL4Ud5U62KMTzbzA3t%2FxnvzsA%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=a5739373354969078a5eb2770adc357917ff3ad58d7d20c674c659f1e05757cf","file_size":351,"type":"application/octet-stream"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-12-19T14:26:00.352Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-57198626.507486664,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":84,"voters":["k0z3r0","msultan","foobar7","adolphoramirez","mashoud1122","base_64","sameerphad72","cinzinga","ali","sudi","and 74 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3276243,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the report, I've forwarded it on to the WC team for review.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-31T17:34:13.665Z","updated_at":"2018-08-31T17:34:13.665Z","actor":{"username":"vortfu","cleared":false,"url":"/vortfu","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/982/1ef285fb263d30f189dc6a8038e1d5c46086e9d9_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"automattic","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3364463,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi Simon,\n\nFollowing up on this report. \n\nSince any file operation will cause unserialization with this sort of vulnerability, it was actually [this `is_file` check](https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/includes/admin/importers/class-wc-product-csv-importer-controller.php#L375) which caused the dangerous unserialization before the `WC_Product_Importer_CSV::read` even happened.\n\nTo mitigate, we'll be adding checks to `WC_Product_Importer_CSV::read` and to `WC_Product_CSV_Importer_Controller::import` using `wp_check_filetype` (which doesn't do any file operations) to prevent non-CSV files from getting used in the importer.
