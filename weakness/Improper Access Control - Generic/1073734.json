A given user is able to maintain User Access Control (UAC) feature in Community Plan.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nSetup two accounts let's say Alice and Bob\n\n  1. Login using Alice account and create a workspace with any name say `test-workspace-1`\n  1. Invite Bob to the newly created workspace\n  1. Navigate to Billing section and Click on `Start 30 day trial` for  Standard Subscription. This will enable UAC for Alice\n  1. Navigate to Team section and Change the Bob's role to `Collaborator` or `Admin`\n  1. Once role is update, navigate to Billing section and Click on `Select Plan` next to Community Subscription.\n It will pop up a dialog which says \" All users will be given 'owner' permissions and will have access to all projects and settings. \". But the UAC is maintained and Bob has still the same role assigned in Step 4.\n\nIt only reflect the change for `owner` permission when we upgrade to Subscription Plan again.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * The scenario explained is easily reproducible. Let me know If you need any video from me to explain the overall flow step by step.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf the issue persists even after 30 day trial ends, then it makes User Access Control feature Freely available.","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2021-02-10T19:19:25.670Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-20973795.325454187,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":3,"voters":["mansoor0x01","mattberg","hanzhaxors"],"structured_scope":{"databaseId":58435,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"dashboard.doppler.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10300921,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report.
