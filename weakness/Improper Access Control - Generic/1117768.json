However, the \"Create Issue\" allows a particular `Guest` user to create a reference issue for the error and track its status whenever some other user resolves it.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)\n\n1. Consider a private project with `Guest` role user.\n2.  Connect `Sentry` to this project from the `Maintainer` account.\n3. And create new issues in Sentry. This automatically populates these errors in https://gitlab.com/project_name/-/error_tracking/.\n4. Now, consider the request for creating an issue.\n\n     POST Data format for this is as follows: \n     ```\n     issue[title]=Title\n     issue[description]= Description\n     issue[sentry_issue_attributes][sentry_issue_identifier]=Error_Id\n     authenticity_token= your_auth_token\n     ```\n5. Change `Error_Id` parameter to some  Error's reference id value (this is basically Sentry's Error id).\n6. Now, execute the request from `Guest`'s session. This creates an issue for that particular error.\n7. Now, go to the `Maintainer`'s login and resolve the error. This will close the issue that created by the `Guest User` with the message `@Maintainer resolved the corresponding error and closed the issue`.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsing this vulnerability, Guest Users can create issues for  Sentry errors and track their Status.","bounty_amount":"610.0","formatted_bounty":"$610","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":25,"voters":["run_win","ali","xsky","akashhamal0x01","sa1tama0","cryptographer","pr0xh4ck","customdiag","meispi","mss_mf","and 15 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.1,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18138,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"gitlab.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10886414,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @maruthi12,\n\nThank you for submitting this report!
