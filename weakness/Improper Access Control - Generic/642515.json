The invisible folder is not shown, you can only see the visible one. That's great.\n6. if you try to create a folder named \"invisible\" you get an error (that's good too) sync the new external share to your pc (in my case win7 with 2.5.2 client). Only the \"visible\" folder is synced.\n7. create a folder named \"temp\" and create inside this new folder a new file (lets say \"test2.txt\"). This folder will be synced online\n8. rename temp to invisible\n9. the folder gets synced online overwriting the originale \"invisible\" folder\n\n###Expected behaviour\n\nThe sync client should keep denying the syncronization of \"invisible\" folder to the unauthorized users\n\n###Actual behaviour\n\nThe folder is synced, the original one and all its content (that should be inaccessible to test user) are overwritten and lost\n\n## Impact\n\nAn \"attacker\" - that could simply be an user with low privileges - can delete sensitive data that were on purpose hidden to its group.","bounty_amount":"250.0","formatted_bounty":"$250","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-04-10T16:13:42.394Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-47430043.57860048,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":165,"voters":["wi11","a_d_a_m","mashoud1122","th4nu_0x0","mirhat","slaxxx","ali","killinem_sec","5050thepiguy","what_web","and 155 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5315554,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for reporting this potential issue back to us!\n\nOur security team will take a look at this issue as soon as possible.
