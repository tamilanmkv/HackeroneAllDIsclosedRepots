I haven't saved any data, nor screenshot of what I have found, apart from the one attached\n\n1. Go to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org in a private window\n2. In the top right bar, insert `Resolve \"Account takeover due to IDOR on customers.gitlab.com [applicable for gitlab users only]\"`\n3. Select \"Merge requests\"\n4. You see in the search result a MR that should be private, since the `customer-gitlab-com` project has no public code/MR\n5.

Go to https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org in a private window\n2. In the top right bar, insert `In order to create an account for the [admin panel]`\n3. Select \"Code\"\n4. You see a piece of the README of customers.gitlab.com, which has a private code\n5.
