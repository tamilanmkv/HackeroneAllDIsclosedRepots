The attacker then can perform any action within the user's account that the API allows.","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":2,"voters":["styrene","sl33pyp0t4t0"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6262935,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
