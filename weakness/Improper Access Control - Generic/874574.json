An email is then being sent to the Shop owner and it only includes the Partner's Business Name and it also links to the **Collaborator Request Review** to either accept or decline it.\n\nTaking that into consideration, if a Partner's change his email address without validating it once a request is sent, the Shopify shop owner's is being displayed the non-verified business email which could lead him to accept a malicious user.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Login to your Partner's account which has a verified email\n2. Make a request to add a managed Shopify Store to your account\n3. Go to Settings and update your **Business Email** \n4. Login to the managed Shopify shop and review the Collaborator Request, the non-verified email will be displayed\n\nAs a side note, this also leads to Information Disclosure (https://hackerone.com/bugs?report_id=853919) as if the above process is done and you do change the Partner's email to let's say victim@shopify.com, once the Collaborator Request is accepted and you Log-in through the Partner's dashboard, you'll be shown victim@shopify.com stores into the dropdown.\n\n## Demo\n██████\n\n## Impact\n\nA Partner's is being able to spoof his confirmed email address by a non-verified one in store management request","bounty_amount":"1000.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,000","weakness":{"id":26,"name":"Improper Access Control - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":7,"voters":["drsniper","ali","realtess","lusiferwings","flok33","maximilienblank","fancy_hacker"],"structured_scope":{"databaseId":422,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"partners.shopify.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8015776,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi @francisbeaudoin,\nThank you for your report!
