Meaning, the info that you could retrieve with team_members.json was already exposed in other functions. Since the json provides nothing new, this was not considered information disclosure. \n\nAs you can imagine, we are a company with active engineering efforts  - meaning that we always actively have code changes in our codebase. We had recently done a complete refactor around permissions and authorization for endpoints (for reports that I'm sure you've seen - where there had been disclosures of data that was *otherwise unable to retrieve*, and where the user was *under no reason supposed to see*), and are still continuing to improve our consistency in the platform. The change you see is related to enforcing ideal code hygiene. \n\nThis behaviour that you had outlined before did not leak any information. My colleague closed it as Informative (even though it should have been NA, since it was not an issue). Our code change happened to change the behaviour of team_members.json, but it did not remove the data that used to be shown - again, a team member can still easily use the autosuggest function to get the same info. \n\nTherefore we do not consider your report an issue. We merely improved out codebase - we did not \"fix\" what you reported. We hope you understand our decisions. We invite you to report issues should you find leakage of data where the user otherwise cannot access, and should not access. \n\nBest,\nHackerOne","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-03-30T18:34:27.281Z","updated_at":"2016-03-30T18:34:27.281Z","actor":{"username":"vwv","cleared":false,"url":"/vwv","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/018/657/6013b6e14358165515258ba7cb8c1597c7901062_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":879786,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"OOpppps.
