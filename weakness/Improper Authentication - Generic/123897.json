This user-friendly approach helps to avoid loss of work in web pages that require extensive input data due to server-side silently expired sessions.\n\n\nWith the goal of detecting (and, in some scenarios, protecting against) user misbehaviors and session hijacking, it is highly recommended to bind the session ID to other user or client properties, such as the client IP address, User-Agent, or client-based digital certificate. If the web application detects any change or anomaly between these different properties in the middle of an established session, this is a very good indicator of session manipulation and hijacking attempts, and this simple fact can be used to alert and/or terminate the suspicious session.\n\n\n","bounty_amount":"1.0","formatted_bounty":"$1","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":3,"voters":["trabajoduro","zeroknife","dyabla"],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":845356,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportTitleUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-03-17T11:47:40.551Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T11:47:40.551Z","additional_data":{"old_title":"Session logout mechanism","new_title":"auto-logout after 20 minutes"},"actor":{"username":"whit537","cleared":false,"url":"/whit537","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/034/094/b38b9225fd8592d05d5e6939116e8f30d7c98af5_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":845362,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I don't believe we want to take this approach, because Gratipay has a social element.
