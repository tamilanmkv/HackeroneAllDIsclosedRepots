Grabbing the banner on this port revealed that it's running Zookeeper:\n```\nZookeeper version: 3.5.1-alpha-1693007, built on 07/28/2015 07:19 GMT\n```\nSo you found an open, how does this affect Shopify?\n====================\nZookeeper installations does not deploy any authentication by default, this makes it very easy for remote attackers to abuse Zookeeper installations, gather information and cause havoc inside Zookeeper clusters by killing the servers (my tests showed that the kill command is available on this instance). After some testing, I found that I was able to run all the commands that are only allowed to be run by admins!
