Allowing access from all domains means that any domain can perform two-way interaction with the application via this request. Unless the response consists only of unprotected public content, this policy is likely to present a security risk.\nProduction Steps: Just look at the header. You found Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * .\nThe HTML5 cross-origin resource sharing policy controls whether and how content running on other domains can perform two-way interaction with the domain which publishes the policy. The policy is fine-grained and can apply access controls per-request based on the URL and other features of the request. If another domain is allowed by the policy, then that domain can potentially attack users of the application.\nIf a user is logged in to the application, and visits a domain allowed by the policy, then any malicious content running on that domain can potentially retrieve content from the application, and sometimes carry out actions within the security context of the logged in user. Even if an allowed domain is not overtly malicious in itself, security vulnerabilities within that domain could potentially be leveraged by a third-party attacker to exploit the trust relationship and attack the application which allows access.\n\nHTTP Header or Code:\n GET /sockjs/info?cb=pcgb37npst HTTP/1.1\nHost: app.legalrobot.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nReferer: https://app.legalrobot.com/profile\nCookie: __cfduid=d07034ecc66ad8b762187ba56471053821472189223; __asc=9d8907e8156c551ef42d543d803; __auc=9d8907e8156c551ef42d543d803; _ga=GA1.2.1063111763.1472189297; galaxy-sticky=!fqm5S7o42sAL2eD8T-pcd7; ajs_anonymous_id=%22200f23d8-2cc8-4d1d-9d52-7699609e8c77%22; meteor_login_token=AP4RUAwKw32XsaKZMv6jKZWuLP5kw7QL17l2ezpplai; _gat=1\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Fri, 26 Aug 2016 05:40:43 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: *\nCache-Control: no-store, no-cache, no-transform, must-revalidate, max-age=0\nVary: Origin\nStrict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nServer: cloudflare-nginx\nCF-RAY: 2d84f357b9b030cc-SIN\nContent-Length: 79\n\n{\"websocket\":true,\"origins\":[\"*:*\"],\"cookie_needed\":false,\"entropy\":1959258093}\n\nAdditional Info: Cross-site HTTP requests are HTTP requests for resources from a different domain than the domain of the resource making the request. For instance, a resource loaded from Domain A (http://domaina.example) such as an HTML web page, makes a request for a resource on Domain B (http://domainb.foo), such as an image, using the img element (http://domainb.foo/image.jpg). This occurs very commonly on the web today â€” pages load a number of resources in a cross-site manner, including CSS stylesheets, images and scripts, and other resources.\n\nThank You","bounty_amount":"20.0","formatted_bounty":"$20","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication -
