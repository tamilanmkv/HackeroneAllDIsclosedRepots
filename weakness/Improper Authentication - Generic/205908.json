I do not want to duplicate the user list filter into the login attributes. That's totally misleading. The LDAP Users configuration page says: \"Nextcloud access is limited to users meeting these criteria\". That's what I expect from that configuration. That's how all other LDAP client software I have configured in the past does.\n\nYou configure the userlist filter. You check the count and it shows the correct count. After configuration you check the Users page and you see all users listed which match the userlist filter. But you nowhere see any of those other users which have been able to log in. Basically they are hidden from view although they can access the nextcloud server.\n\nRequiring the admin to duplicate the filter into the login attributes is simply wrong and just causes serious security issues. We just accidentally noticed that other users where able to access the server. I guess there are many other installations out there which have the exact problem and won't notice until you look very carefully which account directories have been created on the server. Also, remember that duplicating the exact filter is erroneous. You must always remember and make sure that both filters are in sync. Seriously?\n\nI think it's mandatory that the user filter does exactly what it says: \"Nextcloud access is limited to users meeting these criteria\". And the login attributes page should just create the link between the login name entered by the user to the LDAP user entry.\n\nThat's also the way how you are lead during initial configuration: you set up the user filter first, check the user count, find it O.K. and thus expect for the next steps that this filter is active and used everywhere for user access.\n\nThus I can only ask you to please fix this. This is a security issues. And please not by adding remarks on the configuration page but by applying the userlist filter at all places where user accounts are accessed. Can't be too hard to do as you only have to AND the login \"filter\" with the userlist filter at all occurrences of the login \"filter\".
