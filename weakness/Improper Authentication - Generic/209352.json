If you monitor the HTTP Requests that are done while that page is loaded, you will come to know that the 'Password Leakage Link' is leaked to third party websites.\n\nThe owner of that website can perform a security compromise by grabbing those links.\n\n**Q. How will can account takeover be done?**\nAns: The third party has the password reset link. So they will request it in the browser. In the link, the email is also there. So, they know the username and they will set a new password and now they can use this information to perform complete account takeover.\n\n**Additional Information:**\nThe referrer header does not need a user interaction i.e. clicking the third party link. All the links are instantaneously transferred without any dependence on some other action.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe solution is very very SIMPLE. Just include the following HTML code in the following in code between \u003chead\u003e tags of the html of the page: \u003cmeta name=\"referrer\" content=\"never\" /\u003e \nThis will not send referrer headers to third party websites.\n\n\n**Reproduction Instructions / Proof of Concept**\n1.
