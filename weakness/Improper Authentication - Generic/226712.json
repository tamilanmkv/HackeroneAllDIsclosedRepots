And after a particular he realized that he left his account logged in, and there is a security provided that when a user changes his account password all other sessions should invalidate or expire, which will expire the session from that shared computer.\n\nBut in your web application, I didn't found any such security that invalidate the session after password. Here if any user left his account logged in, any attacker can misuse the victim's account and there is no option available to the victim to invalidate the session on that shared computer which could lead to some major problems.\n\n\n\u003eSteps to reproduce the bug :\n\u003eStep 1 : Go to Browser A at (say Mozilla Firefox) and login with your credentials at https://bridge.cspr.ng/ and login with your credentials.\n\n\u003eStep 2 : Similarly, Go to Browser B at (say Google Chrome) and login with your same credentials at https://bridge.cspr.ng/ and login with your credentials.\n\n\u003eStep 3 : Suppose Browser A (Mozilla Firefox) is an shared computer's browser, and you left your account logged in at that computer. Go to Browser B (Google Chrome) and change your account\npassword at https://bridge.cspr.ng/my/account.\n\n\u003eStep 4 : When you change your account password at Browser B (Google Chrome), the session at Browser A (Mozilla Firefox) should expire and the account should automatically logged out.\n\n\u003eStep 5 : Go to Browser A (Mozilla Firefox), and visit your https://bridge.cspr.ng/ account page and refresh the page.\n\nYou will notice that even after changing the account password at Browser B (Google Chrome), the session at Browser A (Mozilla Firefox) didn't expired which can cause major problems.\n\nPlease fix the bug and let me know if you need any other information.\n\nRegards\nK.
