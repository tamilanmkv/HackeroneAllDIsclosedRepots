Here are the reprdouce steps below.\nReproduce steps:\n\n1.Open app.legalrobot-uat.com \n2.Open registration form.\n3.Fill all the fields but when going for a password write a password like this ''abcdefghijklmn''\n4.And your account was successfully created with this simple type of password and can easily be guessed.\nFix Or Reccomendation: \nAccording to password policy for choosing a secure and complex password we must consider the following points in password policy: \nPasswords should use three of four of the following four types of characters:\n1.Lowercase\n2.Uppercase\n3.Numbers\n4.Special characters such as !@#$%^\u0026*(){}[]\n\nIn reproduce steps you can see the password which is ''abcdefghijklmn''. there is no uppercase letter forced,no numbers forced and no special characters forced by your website. If you want to make your password complexity good your should consider these four points in your password field written above. \ni usually when visit other websites and go for registering an account and when writing a password in password i observe that these password complexity points are forced by the website and you cant make a password like ''abcdefghijklmn'' which can easily guessed by someone.\n\nHope you'll triage this. \nThanks \nRegards: \nHusnain Iqbal","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":2,"voters":["t4ym","yato1989"],"structured_scope":{"databaseId":521,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"app.legalrobot-test.com","max_severity":"none"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1957837,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"My point is that some time it not depends from you the user choice but I think that by telling them the right way to choose, is the best solution","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-08-27T06:24:50.899Z","updated_at":"2017-08-27T06:24:50.899Z","actor":{"username":"ihusnain49","cleared":false,"url":"/ihusnain49","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/188/185/edd12799897d2b0b4f5b59d45cbd0cf4d10cc4e0_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"legalrobot","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1964908,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Updates Team?
