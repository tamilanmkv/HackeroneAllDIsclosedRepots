If you're downloading tracks without paying, then I'm sure you could find a copy somewhere on the internet anyway. But I guess it's still an issue.\r\n\r\nWhen browsing the Music Store (https://vimeo.com/musicstore), some tracks are free. To download these, a `GET` request is sent to `/musicstore/download`, with a query string of `track_id=[track_id]\u0026license_id=4`.\r\n\r\nFor non-free tracks, the link is replaced with an Add to Cart icon, and you're expected to go through the checkout procedure. This is done by a `POST` request to `/cart/music`with a body of `action=add\u0026license_id=2\u0026license_name=Personal\u0026price=1.99\u0026track_id=110947\u0026track_title=Remind%2BMe\u0026uid=110947_2\u0026\u0026\u0026token=[token]`.\r\n\r\nCopying the `track_id` from the Add to Cart request and transplanting it into the `/musicstore/download` successfully redirects you to Amazon S3 to download the track, despite you not having paid for it.\r\n\r\nNote: I submitted the `GET` request to `/musicstore/download`, but didn't follow the 302 redirect to S3 to download the track since I didn't pay for it. Because of this I can't 100% verify that the resulting file is the track, but judging by the URL it looks like it is.\r\n\r\n### Proof-of-Concept\r\n**Accounts Needed**\r\n* User #1 - Standard Vimeo user\r\n\r\n**Steps**\r\n1. Login, and browse to https://vimeo.com/musicstore\r\n2. Find a **non-free** track, and click the Add to Cart icon\r\n3. Inside the `POST` request to `/cart/music` copy the `track_id`\r\n4. Browse to the following URL, replacing `[track_id]` with the one from step 3. You should be redirected to S3 to download the track (without paying): `https://vimeo.com/musicstore/download?track_id=[track_id]\u0026license_id=4`\r\n\r\nIf you need anymore info just shout,\r\nCheers,\r\nJack","bounty_amount":"250.0","formatted_bounty":"$250","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-03-01T23:09:42.016Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-208713028.63491434,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["ngalog"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":319187,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-01-27T21:06:29.638Z","updated_at":"2015-01-27T21:06:29.638Z","actor":{"username":"andrewp","cleared":false,"url":"/andrewp","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/966/b9d700976d0952781d36b6dbd46cb36c8ec59da9_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"vimeo","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":320507,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-01-29T14:34:18.911Z","updated_at":"2015-01-29T14:34:18.911Z","actor":{"username":"andrewp","cleared":false,"url":"/andrewp","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/966/b9d700976d0952781d36b6dbd46cb36c8ec59da9_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"wkcaj","url":"/wkcaj"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"vimeo","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":320508,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-01-29T14:34:26.759Z","updated_at":"2015-01-29T14:34:26.759Z","actor":{"url":"/vimeo","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/056/c3188aa0fc4a95fd486b5ee1f4b2d0b90da111d3_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Vimeo"}},"bounty_amount":"250.0","bounty_currency":"usd","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"vimeo","collaborator":{"username":"wkcaj","url":"/wkcaj"},"actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":320511,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Actually I don't believe the fix is live for this yet, should be soon.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-01-29T14:35:00.572Z","updated_at":"2015-01-29T14:35:00.572Z","actor":{"username":"andrewp","cleared":false,"url":"/andrewp","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/966/b9d700976d0952781d36b6dbd46cb36c8ec59da9_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"vimeo","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":321706,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-01-30T23:09:40.967Z","updated_at":"2015-01-30T23:09:40.967Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"andrewp","cleared":false,"url":"/andrewp","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/966/b9d700976d0952781d36b6dbd46cb36c8ec59da9_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"vimeo","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":343879,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-03-01T23:09:50.545Z","updated_at":"2015-03-01T23:09:50.545Z","actor":{"url":"/vimeo","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/056/c3188aa0fc4a95fd486b5ee1f4b2d0b90da111d3_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Vimeo"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"vimeo","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
