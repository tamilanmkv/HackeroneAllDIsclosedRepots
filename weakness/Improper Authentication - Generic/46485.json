Thus, when Account A login and click the button to give the authorization. It is supposed behavior that the third-party app/website will be able to get the oauth access token and then let a browser which has sent the request_token to login.

When Account A give the authorization, he is logged in to the third party application i.e. unfollowerstat.com.\nBut anyone sitting remotely, who has that Token and logged in with Twitter as Account B, also gets logged in into that third party application as Twitter Account A. \nOne oauth token, Account A granting permission and Two people gets logged in with the third party App with twitter Account \"A\" data.

I get the oauth token i.e. https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authenticate?oauth_token=xxxxxxxx\n4. I did not move forward and shared this link with someone who is logged in with Twitter as TwiiterAccount02.\n5. TwitterAccount02 grants the permission to the third Party App.\n6. TwitterAccount02 gets the Dashboard of third party App i.e. unfollowerstat.com. (No Issue , Till now)\n7. Now I, who is logged in with twitter as TwitterAccount01 move further(as I stopped moving further in step 4), I ALSO GET THE DASHBOARD OF THIRD PARTY APP i.e. unfollowerstat.com FOR THE TWITTER USER TWITTERACCOUNT02.
