Its just a test account, as you might assume.\n\nAs for the report, you are now starting to mix \"block\" functionality with \"protected tweets\". Both are not the same but different means for different goals.\nThe **blocking** function is meant to block someone from annoying you on twitter. It's another means to mute an account. It does **not** mean the person you are blocking cannot view your tweets/followers.\n\nThe **protected tweets** function i already explained. It will protect your tweets , and by that i mean only the text of your tweet from being available publicly. \n\nHope this helps.
