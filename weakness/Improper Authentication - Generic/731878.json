Mail.ru shows the spoofing message passes both DKIM and DMARC authentication. \n\nVideo link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X3-TpaLnMZTpJOB3FzWt4K4SB1T3NQc9\n\nProblem explanation\n----------------------------\nThe threat model of this attack is same-domain spoofing, which means the attacker who has an account on the target email services and tries to impersonate another user's address (e.g., administrator) of the same domain.  \n\nThe spoofing attack proceeds in two phases. First, the attacker uses their account to email themselves through the email provider server. In the email, the attacker can create deceptive content in the email body, Subject header and To header, but not the From header given the Mail.ru's strict validation. When the Mail.ru server sends the message, it attaches its DKIM signature to the message.\n\nSecond, the attacker adds an extra From header with another user’s address to the DKIM-signed message and resends it to a victim. When the victim’s email server receives the message, its DKIM component may verify the original From header, and the message passes both DKIM and DMARC verification, while the MUA may show the fake From header.\n\nThe problem in the second step is that the Mail.ru server has strict message validation on the incoming messages, and rejects messages with multiple From headers. So we need another trick to bypass the validation. Here is the message we crafted in the video: (Note that the message has two From headers. In the first one, there is whitespace between the From and colon.)\n\n```\nFrom : Mail.ru Team \u003cadmin@accounts.mail.ru\u003e\nFrom: \u003cattacker@mail.ru\u003e\nTo: \u003cvictim@mail.ru\u003e\n\nDear customer ...\n```\n\n Mail.ru verifies the second one, and generate \"pass\" results for both DKIM and DMARC authentication, but Mail.ru web interface displays it as `admin@accounts.mail.ru`.\n\nSteps to reproduce\n--------------------------\nI skipped the phase one because I have generated a spoofing message with my Mail.ru account and embed it into my scripts. If you want to reproduce the phase one, please let me know.\n\n1. Download the tool I used in the demo video:  https://github.com/chenjj/espoofer\n\n2. Download the file ambiguous-replay-mailru.py into the main directory: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LuoqhWfcW3bfo5dmgZfchJuoRdDXXVOB\n\n3. Change the \"victim_address\" in ambiguous-replay-mailru.py to a Mail.ru recipient address.\n\n4. Run the code: python3 ambiguous-replay-mailru.py\n\nHow to fix\n--------------\nThere may be two options can be applied to prevent this attack:\n\n1) Email server and client should be consistent in interpreting the spoofing message.\n\n2) Mail.ru server could use the \"oversign\" solution (suggested in RFC 6376 section 8.15) for outgoing messages,  i.e., repeat important headers, to prevent replay attacks, such as using “h=from:from:subject:subject:to:to. . .\". This will prevent attackers from replaying Mail.ru DKIM signatures on other email providers.  According to our testing, Yahoo.com has adopted this solution.\n\n## Impact\n\nA regular user of email services may send DKIM-signed messages as any other user (e.g., administrator) of the domain to a Mail.ru recipient.\n\nApart from Mail.ru,  this attack can also be used to forge DKIM signatures of other email services, such as Gmail, Outlook, and other public or private services, to a Mail.ru recipient","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-09-01T23:52:30.468Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-34961322.49306696,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":17,"voters":["ali","impramodsargar","naategh","zimmer75","cryptographer","l_user","leskander","adoumadje","roadkill_jim99","ranamtayyab1","and 7 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":5.0,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":245,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"e.mail.ru","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6252885,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for reporting your bug to Mail.Ru Group!

I cannot reproduce this issue now.\n \nWe found some other bugs affecting Mail.ru in recent research.   \n\nHere is our full research paper: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1INZv_CX5Zur-4Dui9mq_UpupgqAC28et.   \n\nIn particular, the following issues haven't been noted in the previous reports.\n\n1) Spoofing via an email service account. (A17 in the paper)\nThe threat model of this attack is also the same-domain spoofing. An attacker who has an account on the target legitimate email services tries to use a custom MUA to sent spoofing emails through the service.  The problem arises when an email provider does not perform sufficient checks on the From header, enabling an attacker to send a signed message with another user’s address (e.g., administrator).\n\nIn our testing, the Mail.ru server can prevent most spoofing cases, except the following one, ``From: admin@mail.ru\\,\u003cattacker@mail.ru\u003e``.  Mail.ru server only checks whether the second address matches the authenticated username, but other reviving services, such as Hotmail.com, Yahoo.com, Naver.com, Tutanota.com web interface display the first address. As the message is sent by Mail.ru server and has Mail.ru's DKIM signature attached, it will pass the receiver’s DKIM and DMARC validation.\n\n2) Replay attacks. (A15, A16 in the paper)\nStrictly speaking, they are not Mail.ru bugs.  But I'm not sure whether Mail.ru can prevent such attacks by showing a warning for exploiting messages, such as messages that have duplicate Subject headers, or messages with a body longer than the length specified in the l= tag. \n\nAs many attacks in the paper involve different parties, we would like to hear your thoughts or comments, especially how to mitigate those attacks.

As signers, we will perform oversign for From:Subject:Content-Type:Content-Transfer-Encoding:To:Cc. Currently oversign is disabled because there were known DKIM compatibility issues with oversign in some DKIM validation implementations. We have plans to re-enable it in Q1 2020. Currently, we sign all important headers. \n\nI think there are few flaws in your research:\n1. You do not distinguish between DKIM signing implementation problems, DKIM+DMARC validation problems, antispam/antiphishing implementation and client implementation problems in resulting test table. It makes testing results absolutely unclear. E.g. if both DKIM validator and client have a same parsing bug, it will give a negative results for DMARC spoofing in your table, but it actually can be used to e.g. spoof the sender on the over side (e.g. one GMail user can spoof another GMail user if sending message to Yahoo, this is real example).\n2. You do not distinguish between DKIM+DMARC validation blocking and antispam/antiphishing filtering. \n3. The choice of the clients is unclear. Every large mailbox provider like Mail.Ru has it's own client application for iOS/Android. IMAP/POP3 is used by less than 10% of our users, most users use Mail.Ru native applications or web interface.  You can check Mail.Ru application against different mailbox providers and get quite interesting results.\nThe choice of the test is also unclear. Than I did similar tests in the past, I was able to bypass every implementation tested.  Some examples can be found in this thread:\nhttp://lists.dmarc.org/pipermail/dmarc-discuss/2014-July/003012.html\nIf you were unable to bypass something, you probably just have to try harder, because vectors are always implementation specific.\n\nA resume: You have checked few client applications with unclear choice with their own implementation problems with few vectors with unclear choice against different servers with random results affected by antispam/antiphishing filtering and unrelated conclusions.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-12-06T09:39:39.137Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T09:53:23.013Z","actor":{"username":"3apa3a","cleared":false,"url":"/3apa3a","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/836/57b93fd96b524d0ed13eef717ecd070ad8468f86_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mailru","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6486806,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks a lot for the professional comments.

Most of them are from https://emailclientmarketshare.com/.\n\nWe chose to test email providers that 1) verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC for incoming email, 2) allow us to register accounts for testing, and 3) reflect SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication results in the email headers, so that we can verify the results. We collected 25 popular email providers by searching Google and found 10 satisfied the three requirements.\n\n\u003e Some examples can be found in this thread: http://lists.dmarc.org/pipermail/dmarc-discuss/2014-July/003012.html\n\nThanks for sharing the link. Looks interesting,  I will read it. \n\n\u003e A resume: You have checked few client applications...\n\nThis paper doesn’t aim to provide a comprehensive measurement study, but aims to illustrate the harmful consequences of inconsistencies in email systems. Due to the limitation of black-box testing, this paper doesn’t identify all the vulnerabilities in email services and clients. We admit that what we found only constitute a subset of the problem space.\n\nFinally, this academic paper doesn’t intend to compare the security of different email providers or clients.   Because many inconsistency issues are hard to be fixed by a single implementation completely, and cannot simply represent the security of each affected implementation. According to our experiences, Mail.ru is doing very well in authenticating email messages and handling the security reports.  Probably we should clarify this point in the paper.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-12-06T20:48:35.985Z","updated_at":"2019-12-06T20:48:35.985Z","actor":{"username":"jianjun","cleared":false,"url":"/jianjun","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mailru","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8830595,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Could this issue be disclosed for the community to learn?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-08-02T23:52:30.442Z","updated_at":"2020-08-02T23:52:30.442Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"jianjun","cleared":false,"url":"/jianjun","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mailru","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9087346,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-08-31T12:53:56.330Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T12:53:56.330Z","actor":{"username":"3apa3a","cleared":false,"url":"/3apa3a","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/836/57b93fd96b524d0ed13eef717ecd070ad8468f86_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mailru","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9087347,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-08-31T12:53:56.437Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T12:53:56.437Z","actor":{"username":"3apa3a","cleared":false,"url":"/3apa3a","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/836/57b93fd96b524d0ed13eef717ecd070ad8468f86_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mailru","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9087389,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-08-31T12:59:12.498Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T12:59:12.498Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Medium","new_severity":"Medium (5.0)","old_severity_id":559193,"new_severity_id":833539},"actor":{"username":"3apa3a","cleared":false,"url":"/3apa3a","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/836/57b93fd96b524d0ed13eef717ecd070ad8468f86_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mailru","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"id":24247,"category":"team","content":"An insufficient filtering in combination with inconsistency in DMARC verification logic and visual representation of sender data allowed to spoof sender's address for DMARC-protected domain with malformed e-mail message.","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false,"attachments":[],"user":{"id":4836,"username":"3apa3a","name":"Vladimir Dubrovin","bio":"En la agostada senda he visto al buen lagarto (gota de cocodrilo) meditando.
