This allows access to admin panels that are secured by needing an email address at your domain.takeover.\nGoogle Docs, Slack Chats, anywhere the authentication needed is an email address at your domain is now accessible with this risk.\n\nThis also allows access to the postmaster account for the subdomain, which will allow me to whitelist SSL issuing aliases via email validation:\n\nhttps://support.dnsimple.com/articles/ssl-certificates-email-validation/#requirements\nhttps://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/validation/not-receiving-dcv-emails.htm\n\n\nPlease see my POC (Pug of Concept)\nhttp://api.e2e-kops-aws-canary.test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io\n\nPOC Video:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20191125154616/http://api.e2e-kops-aws-canary.test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io/\n\nSupport for High Impact Rating: (7.5)\n\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-14389\n\nAttack Vector (AV): Network\nAttack Complexity (AC): Low\nPrivileges Required (PR): None\nUser Interaction (UI): None\nScope (S): Unchanged\nConfidentiality (C): None\nIntegrity (I): High\nAvailability (A): None\n\n\n\nPlease verify your dns settings have been updated lag for domain propagation can take place.\nhttps://dnschecker.org/#A/api.e2e-kops-aws-canary.test-cncf-aws.canary.k8s.io\n\nOptions How to fix:\n\n1) Remove the Name Server records that point to Name Servers you do not control.\n\n2) Ask me to remove my registered Name Servers on AWS Route 53 and you can re register yours :)\n\nMay you be well on your side of the screen :)\n\n-Eric\n\n## Impact\n\nImpact:\n\nCyber attackers can launch a phishing campaign leveraging your established (soon to be impacted) brand reputation.\n\nThe victim has no way of telling, whether the content is served by the domain owner or the cyber attacker.\n\nAttackers can also chain higher severity attacks to this. Many applications expose session cookies to a wildcard domain (*.example.com),\nso any subdomain can access them. An attacker can take a forgotten subdomain, trick the user to visit it, and extract cookies \n(even those with secure flag). This can be seen as an advanced version of XSS.","bounty_amount":"250.0","formatted_bounty":"$250","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-11-29T21:25:46.139Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-27280622.98321066,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":50,"voters":["thaivu","m0chan","drsniper","discodamone","un4gi","nirvana_msu","badcracker","bibekshah","ali","adityarawatadihacks","and 40 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":6.4,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"low"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":34429,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"k8s.io","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6410749,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi ,\n\nThank you for your submission.
