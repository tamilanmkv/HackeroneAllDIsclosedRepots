Visit ███████\n2. Enter user as guest \u0026 password as guest.\n3. Boom!! You are inside the management console of the rabbitmq of unikrn.\n\nP.S I checked that the ssl certificates belong to domain *.dev.unikrn.space which proves that the instance belongs to unikrn and maybe used for production or development.\n\n##Mitigation\nDon't expose the rabbitmq console on the internet \u0026 remove the default credentials.\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\nHere is a screenshot of the list of queue\n███\n\n## Impact\n\nThe impact is critical as the attacker can get hell lot of details by dumping the queues as the queues are having confidential details like sso details \u0026 api details for different assets. Also the default credential has the administrative access which can help the attacker to add a new queue, modify or delete an existing queue etc.","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-01-06T14:36:19.256Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-55644431.79166897,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":98,"voters":["xesh","jensec","gangstersquad","s1r1u5","sameerphad72","spam404","prophet","dhakal_ananda","aryan2808","sudi","and 88 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.7,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"adjacent","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":453,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"unikrn.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":6490499,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Good one.
