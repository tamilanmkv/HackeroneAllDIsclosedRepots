This could be achieved by having a mapping from uploaded_filename to actual_key_in_s3 (is there a way to tell S3 how the downloaded file should be named?). \n\nConclusion\n====\nIn my book this is fraud and shouldn't be there ;) You might consider the approach to control 100% of the bucket key to rule an entire class of bugs/vulnerabilities here out as filtering of the filename is tricky and will probably fail (now or in the near feature, who knows what S3 offers as a neat new 'feature' in the future).  Also there are just too many variants on how things could get wrong, what comes to mind is: Encoding interpretation failures on the app side, hidden/not well documented features on the AWS side,...","bounty_amount":"1500.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,500","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-11-19T20:24:04.025Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-186002373.57685325,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["spetr0x"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":622251,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for reporting this bug!
