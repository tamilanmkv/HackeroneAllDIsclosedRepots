Add a new staff member and give him access to `settings`. \n2. Login with the Staff member account and go to `https://\u003cyour_store\u003e.myshopify.com/admin/fulfillment_services/signup_for_mws` , you'll be redirected to a link in amazon.com that looks like this :\n\n```\nhttps://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/mws/registration/register.html/188-6388224-3450104?ie=UTF8\u0026AWSAccessKeyId=\u003cKEY\u003e\u0026Signature=\u003cSginature\u003e\u0026SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256\u0026SignatureVersion=2\u0026id=\u003cid\u003e\u0026returnPathAndParameters=%3Fshop_id%3D000000\u0026signInPageDisplayed=1\n```\n3.- Save this link then logout and login with the owner account after that delete the staff member account you have added. \n5.- Open a new browser , go to the link you have saved , login with your amazon account , authorize shopify and the account will be added to the store.\n6.- login to the store admin then go to `https://\u003cyour_store\u003e.myshopify.com/admin/settings/shipping/fulfillment_dropshipping` and you'll see that the account was added.\n7 - Do the step #5 more and more and the account will be added more and more times. \n\nThis means that the link you saved can be used anytime to add unlimited malicious amazon marketplace web services account without any need of admin access.\n\nThe cause of the vulnerability is that the endpoint used to add the amazon account is (`https://app.shopify.com/services/ping/amazon_mws?shop_id=\u003cShop_id\u003e `) and doesn't validate for any admin permissions.\n\nPlease tell me if you are having any issue reproducing this , I can send you a PoC video.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":27,"name":"Improper Authentication - Generic"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-12-18T20:07:49.372Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-183498077.59819877,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":2,"voters":["powerjacobb1","spetr0x"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":655937,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for reporting this bug!
