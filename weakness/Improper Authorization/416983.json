Login to your shop as the shop owner and add a staff member with only \"Apps\" permission.\n2. Install flow app: https://apps.shopify.com/flow\n3. Login with the new user you added and navigate to `https://[Your-Shop].myshopify.com/admin/apps/flow/connectors`\n4. Click All **Settings** links next to Google Sheets, Trello and Asana and save them\n5. Login with the shop owner and remove the user you added\n6. You can now use the links you saved to modify connectors settings.\n\n**Live PoC:**\nYou can modify my shop's google spread sheet connection by navigating to `https://flow-connectors.shopifycloud.com/gsheet/connect?shop_id=24615823\u0026path_hmac=%2BPnVhhFIC49KrHZGqwC08LoSMSkieG7UHWgtnriV2vQ%3D`\n\n## Impact\n\nThrough this vulnerability a removed staff member will be able to modify google spread sheet, trello and asana connections to connect his own accounts so that workflow actions regarding the connections go to his accounts and therefore he can still access the shop data.","bounty_amount":"2000.0","formatted_bounty":"$2,000","weakness":{"id":124,"name":"Improper Authorization"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":37,"voters":["msultan","drsniper","ali","w1j3r","tungpun","powerjacobb1","malcolmx","exception","codeanddecode","leiz95","and 27 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.6,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":37198,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"Shopify Developed Apps","max_severity":"medium"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3475503,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-13T14:54:14.183Z","updated_at":"2018-10-13T14:54:14.183Z","actor":{"url":"/shopify","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/fjjiC5585s8WoDGHv2M5okbJ/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Shopify"}},"bounty_amount":"2000.0","bounty_currency":"usd","bonus_amount":"0.0","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"shopify","collaborator":{"username":"zombiehelp54","url":"/zombiehelp54"},"actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3475547,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-13T15:07:50.091Z","updated_at":"2018-10-13T15:07:50.091Z","actor":{"username":"francoischagnon","cleared":false,"url":"/francoischagnon","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/019/168/5d577fe97283a5483331257b629b6287ed4d287b_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"shopify","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3588946,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Thanks again for your report.
