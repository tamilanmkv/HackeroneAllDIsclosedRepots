Either way, it does have a minor impact on integrity. For our programs, we have a special sandbox. This is a mode where programs can test our features, including paying bounties. When a bounty is paid in a sandboxed program, the bounty won't be paid out.

The documentation is pretty clear in our opinion, so we don't consider this a security vulnerability.\n\n\u003e I am not getting why the severity is low - coz what if a person makes a sandbox program and files 10 reports on his own and then initiate a retest on all ( in that case 50 researchers would be paid 100$ that sums up to 5k$ ) and that i believe is definitely is a big monetary loss on h1.\n\nBecause the user doesn't actually get the money. If it would, we would consider this a medium or high severity vulnerability.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-11-25T21:09:05.859Z","updated_at":"2018-12-01T00:12:11.738Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3707711,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Well @jobert , thanks for clarifying ( I thought the retest bounty is paid in real ) but if it's not then yes it's definitely not a monetary impact whereas you mentioned a \"special sandbox\"  , where programs test your feature but they cannot work with other researchers , right?? \nNow due to this retest feature I was able to communicate with 5 real researchers and they were awarded 100$ retest bounty ( Now as you said this bounty is not paid actually but these researchers must have been notified for this ( \" You have been awarded 100$ for retest \" ) and hence this could lead the researchers to contact hackerone mediation as the program itself would never pay this bounty ) , Now this would impact hackerone integrity . \nLet's say I made 10 reports and initiated retest on all so now 50 researchers will get notified of 100$ bounty after retest ( but they won't actually get it ) so ultimately they'll contact h1 for mediation , which I suppose is impact on integrity.\n\nNow wrt to rate limits : What exactly is the ratelimit at present ??
