However grtp.co service is running on port 80 too (i.e., running on HTTP protocol even). As we know this can leak lot of information about your target customers.\n\nSide effects:\nURL1) https://github.com/gratipay/grtp.co/blob/master/README.md#examples\n\nFrom the above URL1 page details: you are referring to URLs of grtp.co which targets to HTTP based URLs instead of HTTPS.\nExample code taken from URL 1 mentioned above:\n\u003cscript data-gratipay-username=\"rummik\"\n  data-gratipay-widget=\"button\"\n  src=\"//grtp.co/v1.js\" async\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\nSolution: If we have HTTPS already, what ever the services we host on out web sites should points towards HTTPS URIs/URLs, but not to HTTP based URIs/URLs. This way we can achieve 100% encrypted communication \u0026 guaranty end user's safety. If not an attacker can learn that a about of user's activity happening on HTTP and can setup a fake DNS record to drive \"grtp.co/v1.js\" or \"grtp.co/xxxx\" kind of requests to malicious domain and can serve infected java script files making them fall as his/her pray.\n\n2 Issue Details: Information Disclosure\n\nLeaking lot of technical details during discussions with H1 researchers\nExample: https://hackerone.com/reports/116352\n\nThe above issue # 1 was identified while reading the report. That is why I am submitting both issues under one report.\n\nSolution: Keep the details as crispy as possible while sharing with H1 researchers.
