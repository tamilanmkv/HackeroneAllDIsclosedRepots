So, we can say that TOR in Brave protects users from opening anything privileged in the browser.\nBut there is some weird case for: `chrome://downloads` and `brave://inspect/#devices`. Both can be dangerous when there is a UXSS present there because it can get to know about the data. The `brave://device-log/` looks interesting too, why do we see the device log of brave in the TOR Network in the Brave? \n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Open Brave with TOR\n2. Navigate to `brave://inspect/#devices`\n\nExpected behavior?\n--\u003e When we are doing device debugging, it should have opened normal Brave and shouldn't open the privileged URI in the TOR session itself. Open `chrome://bookmarks` and `chrome://history`\n\nActual behavior?\n--\u003e It opens the debugging session inside the protected tor session.\n\nSuggestions?\n--\u003e We should block `chrome://downloads`,  `brave://inspect/#devices`, `brave://device-log/` etc. and when somebody tries to navigate to those URIs, a normal Brave session should be started like we do for `chrome://history` as it keeps TOR away from personal information inside the brave URIs.\n\n## Impact\n\nInformation disclosure.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":1,"voters":["akashhamal0x01"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":7942,"asset_type":"DOWNLOADABLE_EXECUTABLES","asset_identifier":"https://laptop-updates.brave.com/latest/winx64","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":13567907,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Have you found a way for a website to get access to the information displayed on these pages?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-09-21T19:07:45.605Z","updated_at":"2021-09-21T19:07:45.605Z","actor":{"username":"fmarier","cleared":false,"url":"/fmarier","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/460/164/5ccc7f221450d705333b28dc1d4c0eb673b24684_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"brave","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":13568028,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Thank you very much for your swift response. :)\n\nThis is a partial bug but one can access data on those pages if they find UXSS or such cases.

Then, we should be allowing users to open `chrome://history` in the **TOR Network**, yes? :) If yes, we require a change that the Brave will allow `chrome://history`, `chrome://wallet` etc URIs to open in the **TOR Network** and not just `chrome://device-log` etc. :) But anyway, feel free to close this case if you don't see a bug, we should make it public then. If you still think this isn't the case of the bug then, please allow other URIs to open inside the TOR network especially URIs of history inside the **TOR Network**. The next argument will be that in a **TOR Network**, your data should be cleared when you close the browser, yes? Then, open `chrome://downloads` inside the **TOR Network** why isn't that cleared? Why is the data of the brave accessible in the **TOR Network**? The interesting thing is here:\n{F1456704}\nSee that it is showing the URL from where the file was downloaded in the TOR network which is actually the history of the Brave browser, yes? \nSteps to reproduce:\n1. Visit [Download] in the Normal Brave browser and not **TOR Network**\n2. I hope step 1 asked you the path to save now, save it anywhere\n3. Open Brave with **TOR Network**\n4. Navigate to `chrome://downloads`\n\nArgument: Wait. Why are we seeing personal downloads of Brave browser inside TOR network which is completely **separate** from the **brave** browser, this is a violation because, in the TOR network, you shouldn't be able to see the history, downloads, etc data of the browser of the **Brave Browser** and due to this reason when you try to navigate to the `chrome://history`, it will open the Brave browser and not the **open it for you inside the \"TOR Network\"**. Now, let's disclose some more personal data here. We are obviously given the URL from where the file was downloaded just after the name of the file inside the chrome://downloads, why that URL is visible inside the TOR network? \n**Don't we have any privacy that: Brave browser shouldn't access the history/downloads of TOR and also TOR shouldn't access data of the Brave browser?**\n\nI hope I was able to clarify why the issue requires a patch there.\n\n\u003e That does sound like a bug, can you share the details?\n\nPlease find the video PoC attached:\n{F1456705}\n\nFeel free to provide consent to make the vulnerability public.\n\nThanks!\n\n[Download]:

Summary for this case: Commonly, we aren't allowed to access the data of the Brave browser inside the TOR network as it is a privacy violation that's what the reason is Brave with TOR doesn't allow you to open the chrome://history inside a TOR network and also, it won't allow you to open your wallet inside the TOR network but yes, TOR network can violate the privacy and see the downloads of your Brave browser and also a **Tor network** is permitted to perform the device-debugging of the device attached. By this, we should conclude that this was a privacy violation where the TOR network took the past data as well as history (from which location the file was downloaded) inside it's network and unfortunately, the TOR network didn't behave as chrome://history when navigating to chrome://downloads due to which, we were counting this as a bug.
