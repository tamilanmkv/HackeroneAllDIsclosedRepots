A bunch of them are Fortune 500 companies. They were all notified and almost everyone have already been fixed.\n\n# Issue\n\nIssue with NewRelic's account is a bit similar to http://www.geek.com/games/valve-has-56-people-working-on-half-life-3-1572498/. It's occurs because of wrong permissions scheme and leads to leak of some sensitive data. Whether the user is logged in or not in JIRA applications he is able to see all shared filters and dashboards. Basically, the instance is externally exposed to non-logged users.\n\nThere were detected leaking of such internal information:\n\n* employees roles, upcoming milestones, secret project and features through JIRA filters / dashsboards\n\nPlease use urls below to review this leaks:\n\n* https://newrelic.atlassian.net/secure/ConfigurePortalPages!default.jspa?view=popular\n* https://newrelic.atlassian.net/secure/ManageFilters.jspa?filterView=search\u0026Search=Search\u0026filterView=search\u0026sortColumn=favcount\u0026sortAscending=false\n\n# Resolution\n\nAnalyse each specific Filter or Dashboard shared with everyone by looking for \"Shared with all users\", in the \"Manage Filters\" and \"Manage Dashboards\" sections, and grant permissions to specific groups.\n\nThanks.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-03-20T01:41:08.133Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-143985567.75935346,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":7,"voters":["delimitry","spam404","k3ypt0","realtess","eveeez","spetr0x","adsence771"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":966617,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks again, Kamil !
