So basically the attacker would have to guarantee that there is available memory for all the `tor_malloc()` calls, but insufficient memory during ` crypto_pk_get_fingerprint()`.  I'm not claiming this is impossible, but the attacker would require lots of internal knowledge about the box to be attacked.\n\nFinally, next time you open a bug report, it would be great if you could point to particular codepaths in the codebase that can cause an exploitable security scenario. The way I see it, in this report you just said \"Hey Tor guys there are 16 errors in your code. One of them might be exploitable. Please find it and reward me.\". That basically puts the effort on us.

In the case of this particular report for example, it has taken me hours to identify each function that 1) leads to a call to i2d_RSAPublicKey and 2) whose return value is not checked, and investigate each instance as evidenced by the short description I added to each instance. What's more, I added a proof of concept with instructions to proof the premise of the vulnerability. I've also mentioned that there doesn't need to be any \"attacker\" involved since it can occur during any severe \"organic\" memory shortage on the system. It's definitely a corner case, but nonetheless a small risk. My opinion is that my report is sufficiently detailed to warrant a change.\n\nI agree that I have created some reports where I focus on a potential vulnerability within a single function without considering its context (the various possible parameters to a function, the origin of invocations to that functions etc). Usually, whenever I submit a software vulnerability to an open source project, I try to be exhaustive as possible, preferably supplying the maintainers with a proof of concept that works out-of-the-box rather than zooming in on a single function with disregard for the context in which it occurs. The reason this is not always the case with my Tor reports is that Tor has an exceptional call path complexity (it's often difficult for me to figure out how function main() can lead to the vulnerable function) as well as my inability to get Chutney running in a satisfactory way. So whereas I would otherwise discard the potential vulnerability because of an (for me) unsurmountable complexity, I submit it as-is to your program.\n\nBut I will keep your points in mind for the next time.\n\nWhenever you're ready, you may close this report.\n\nGuido","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-06-13T14:30:31.479Z","updated_at":"2016-06-13T14:30:31.479Z","actor":{"username":"guido","cleared":false,"url":"/guido","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/983/e55b0b2324777fb7efc2de4212fd8d337ca816bd_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"torproject","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1012686,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Closing this.
