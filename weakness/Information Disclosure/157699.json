When compiling a list of external_users on a report, check the signal of those users. Apply some trivial statistical methods and you've got yourself a solid probability if a report is valid.

You suggested using the data to contact white-hat hackers to try to convince them to sell you vulnerabilities (turning them to grey- or blackhats, low feasibility) that were already known to the vendor (no 0-days, medium impact). \n\nAn approach that you could take with the same feasibility, and a higher impact, is just cold-calling the hackers and asking them to sell you vulnerabilities. You would run the same kinds of risks, and you'd get actual 0-days instead of having to race the team. \n\nThe reason we awarded a bounty is that we appreciate you calling our attention to the exposure of the data. However, we do not feel that the issue does not warrant a heightened bounty amount.\n\nI hope this answers your question,\nKind regards,\nDirk","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-31T13:54:22.521Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T13:54:22.521Z","actor":{"username":"dirk","cleared":false,"url":"/dirk","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/013/067/f9785240873663ec965b04e725871ed0f69616e7_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1164805,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you very much for the extensive reply.\n\nI fully trust your team's judgement.
