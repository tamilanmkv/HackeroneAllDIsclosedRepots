So this content could be retrieved by other users who have access to the same computer . \n\nThere are two affected uses : \n\n* Photos : because when you use {} to include image or you upload it and open it from attachments you will make the request and local copy of it will be stored without user knowledge . \n\n* Other files (e.g:video,xml,txt...etc.) : when you download  file a copy of it will be stored in cache without user knowledge too. Now this isn't an **usability** event why you cache a file that you will download ?! \n \nThe cache files can be found here :\n\n* Mozilla Firefox:\nUnix/Linux: ~/.mozilla/firefox/\u003cprofile-id\u003e/Cache/\nWindows: C:\\Documents and Settings\u003cuser_name\u003e\\Local Settings\\Application\nData\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\Profiles\u003cprofile-id\u003e\\Cache\n\n* Internet Explorer:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\u003cuser_name\u003e\\Local Settings\\Temporary Internet Files\n\n--------------------\nTools \n=============\n\n* Tools for view cache files :\n   * FF : http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/mozilla_cache_viewer.html \n   * Chrome : http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/chrome_cache_view.html \n   * FF plugin (not recommended ): https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cacheviewer2/?src=api\n \n\nI viewed Frans report using Firefox and the cache viewer got the image I can view it and see the HTTP header \n\n{F114668}\n\nConclusion \n==================\nThe Images stored just by view it .
