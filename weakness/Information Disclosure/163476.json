Given that buckets with other name permutations are set to `AccessDenied`, this appears to be an **ACL misconfiguration**.\n\nIn terms of attack scenario, if Legal Robot engineers upload new sensitive material (e.g. proprietary data) to the bucket, believing that the ACL is correctly configured, there may be a risk to Legal Robot as a result, hence why all other buckets are restricted.\n\nUnfortunately my personal AWS account is inactive, so I have been unable to confirm the ability of an unaffiliated user writing files into the **legalrobot** bucket.\n\nThanks!","bounty_amount":"20.0","formatted_bounty":"$20","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-09-25T17:52:41.535Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-159134149.77089143,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":8,"voters":["dawgyg","r3y","akhilmm","cybert0uch","sa1tama0","spetr0x","localhost1st","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1155150,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks for the report, we'll research the issue shortly.
