The attack is disguised with the IP address of the server and the attacker is able to utilize the high bandwidth of a big machine.\nAn attacker can exhaust additional resources on the machine, e.g. with requests to a service that doesn’t respond or responds with very large files.\nAn attacker may gain knowledge, when, how often and from which IP address a XML document is accessed.\nAn attacker could send mail from inside your network if the URL handler supports smtp:// URIs.\n\n\nDTD retrieval\nAlso with entity declaration, you can have an URL link for replacement (for definition of replacement see previous vulnerability).
