Member has full `Admin` permission to `Test1` and no permission at all to `Test2`. Member wont be able to see the folder `Test2` in his account at all.\n3. Now member selects any file from `Test1` using checkbox and select move option from dropdown. he gets only path to `Test1` folders. \n4. now if i type some random names of the folders in the box and say move, it will throw the error. but if type the valid names of folders which may be in a site, it will say can not write. \n5. this proves that, if you can guess correct name of folder/path, it tells you the existence of the path.\n\n**POC**\nhttps://youtu.be/mzPXVHIDnzs\n\n**Resolution**\nThe response should be same for both requests. folder exist or not, it should throw 404!\n\n\n\n**The date you tested for and found the vulnerability**\n08/10/2016\n\n**The following affirmative statement **\nI HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM.
