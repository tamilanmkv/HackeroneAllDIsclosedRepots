The SMTP server will reply with the login name of the user. This feature can be turned off in sendmail, because allowing it can be a security hole. VRFY commands can be used to probe for login names on a system.\n\nAn example of this using VRFY is given below, where this list of users\n\n```\nadmin\n█████████\n███\nsupport\n████\n████████\nsecurity\ntest\ntest________________________1\n```\n\nis enumerated:\n\n```\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n|                   Scan Information                       |\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMode .....................
