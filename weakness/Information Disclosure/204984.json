This will create a copy of the given attachement ID in the folder given in the JSON input (in the POC case 54). The server wil respond with the new folderID + file id.\n\nThen you can go to you files and see the copy of the targeted id.\n\nI have also attached 2 POC videos.\n\nIn the first you can see the attack. In the first seconds you can see that the `folder` parameter from the GET request is just being used for writing validation, it doesn't really happen anything with it, there is no validation whether the attachement is in the inputted folder or not. Then I will copy all the attachement across all the accounts (for example XXE and exif are in user2's account, and you can see I am logged in with user3).\n\nLater in the video I have clicked the wrong links (while in incognito mode I cannot open files in new tabs because I am logged out), but in the second one you can see the download is working. Also sending the file per email or opening in browser works. That is why I have uploaded video 2.\n\n","bounty_amount":"888.0","formatted_bounty":"$888","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-09-28T07:19:29.212Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-127377785.33681013,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":20,"voters":["jensec","mashoud1122","bl4de","vijay_kumar","realtess","eveeez","r3y","mr_r3boot","t4ym","silv3rpoision","and 10 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1476699,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Thanks for the report, can you please specify where the attachments exist prior to copying them?
