Since then, the configuration of that project seems to have been changed not to perform this operation ([last build] with token found is from 2016-01-06), but the [docsearch] project still [uses it] and leaks algobot's token with every build of the master branch, here's for example [the latest one.]\n\nThis token has a `public_repo` scope, so it gives commit access to any public repositories its owner has access to. So both instantsearch.js and docsearch are affected.\n\nYou may want to verify that there were no suspicious changes since the first leak. Unfortunately I didn't find any way to check the token usage history, so cannot help with that.\n\nNote that I did use this token to get its owner info (GET call to endpoint `https://api.github.com/user`) and repositories that belong to them (GET call to `https://api.github.com/user/repos`), but I didn't attempt to perform any other operations.\n\nAlso, please be sure to avoid disclosing this issue accidentally (e.g. in commit messages), as I'm still working with others that have similar leaks. Revoking/rotating tokens without explanation with simple “updating the token” should be fine though, generally nobody pays attention to them.\n\n[algobot]: https://github.com/algobot\n[instantsearch.js]: https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js\n[docsearch]: https://github.com/algolia/docsearch\n[uses it]: https://github.com/algolia/docsearch/blob/master/scripts/docs/gh-pages.js#L10\n[Travis CI job log]: https://travis-ci.org/algolia/instantsearch.js/jobs/94408476/#L460\n[last build]: https://travis-ci.org/algolia/instantsearch.js/jobs/100608422#L462\n[the latest one.]: https://travis-ci.org/algolia/docsearch/builds/203760306#L419","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-06-10T14:19:14.563Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-136856704.66362625,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":10,"voters":["eveeez","an0nym0us","dalt4sec","khizer47","zerotoone","japz","sumit7","spetr0x","kelaaxhackers1","harpreet1"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1530978,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for the report @sainaen.
