Sending a specially crafted Garlic message can cause the router to send onward an I2P message containing leaked RAM data, triggering a massive information leakage.\n\nTechnical Details:\n===========\n* Code Version: Taken from Github on the 18th of November 2017 - commit 5aafe6608519d31e537c97b24ea7b23aa372dd5b\n* Vulnerable File: src\\core\\router\\garlic.h\n* Vulnerable Function: GarlicDestination::HandleGarlicPayload\n\nThe function is responsible to parse and handle Garlic Payloads: several independent Garlic Cloves.\nWhen handling a clove with a delivery type of \"DeliveryTypeTunnel\" there are insufficient checks on the message, before it is wrapped and sent onward:\n```cpp\n    GarlicDeliveryType delivery_type = (GarlicDeliveryType)((flag \u003e\u003e 5) \u0026 0x03);\n    switch (delivery_type) {\n      case eGarlicDeliveryTypeLocal:\n        LOG(debug) \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: Garlic type local\";\n        HandleI2NPMessage(buf, len, from);\n      break;\n      case eGarlicDeliveryTypeDestination:\n        LOG(debug) \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: Garlic type destination\";\n        buf += 32;  // destination. check it later or for multiple destinations\n        HandleI2NPMessage(buf, len, from);\n      break;\n      case eGarlicDeliveryTypeTunnel: {\n        LOG(debug) \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: Garlic type tunnel\";\n        // gateway_hash and gateway_tunnel sequence is reverted\n        std::uint8_t* gateway_hash = buf;\n        buf += 32;\n        std::uint32_t gateway_tunnel = bufbe32toh(buf);\n        buf += 4;\n        std::shared_ptr\u003ckovri::core::OutboundTunnel\u003e tunnel;\n        if (from \u0026\u0026 from-\u003eGetTunnelPool())\n          tunnel = from-\u003eGetTunnelPool()-\u003eGetNextOutboundTunnel();\n        // EI [BUG-TRACE] : The payload length is based on an unchecked length field\n        // EI             : from the just found I2NP message contained in the clove.\n        // EI\t          : When creating and sending this message onward we may leak\n        // EI             : heap memory data to the destination node [18/11/2017]\n        if (tunnel) {  // we have send it through an outbound tunnel\n          auto msg = CreateI2NPMessage(buf, kovri::core::GetI2NPMessageLength(buf), from);\n          tunnel-\u003eSendTunnelDataMsg(gateway_hash, gateway_tunnel, msg);\n        } else {\n          LOG(debug)\n            \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: no outbound tunnels available for garlic clove\";\n        }\n        break;\n      }\n      case eGarlicDeliveryTypeRouter:\n        LOG(warning) \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: Garlic type router not supported\";\n        buf += 32;\n      break;\n      default:\n        LOG(error)\n          \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: unknown garlic delivery type \"\n          \u003c\u003c static_cast\u003cint\u003e(delivery_type);\n    }\n    buf += kovri::core::GetI2NPMessageLength(buf);  // I2NP\n    buf += 4;  // CloveID\n    buf += 8;  // Date\n    buf += 3;  // Certificate\n    // EI [BUG_TRACE] : This check is too late since the I2NP message was already sent. [18/11/2017]\n    if (buf - buf1  \u003e static_cast\u003cint\u003e(len)) {\n      LOG(error) \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: clove is too long\";\n      break;\n    }\n```\n\nProposed Fix\n---------------\nThe inner I2NP message is parsed and forwarded using it's own length field BEFORE this field is checked for consistency. There is a good sanitation check in the bottom of the function, but the check is preformed only AFTER the message is sent.\n\nThe proposed fix is to copy the current code check to the vulnerable case, and to preform it before the new message is created:\n```cpp\n    case eGarlicDeliveryTypeTunnel: {\n        LOG(debug) \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: Garlic type tunnel\";\n        // gateway_hash and gateway_tunnel sequence is reverted\n        std::uint8_t* gateway_hash = buf;\n        buf += 32;\n        std::uint32_t gateway_tunnel = bufbe32toh(buf);\n        buf += 4;\n        std::shared_ptr\u003ckovri::core::OutboundTunnel\u003e tunnel;\n        if (from \u0026\u0026 from-\u003eGetTunnelPool())\n          tunnel = from-\u003eGetTunnelPool()-\u003eGetNextOutboundTunnel();\n        // EI [BUG-FIX] : added this new check\n        if (buf + kovri::core::GetI2NPMessageLength(buf) + 4 + 8 + 3 - buf1  \u003e static_cast\u003cint\u003e(len)) {\n          LOG(error) \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: clove is too long\";\n          break;\n        }\n        if (tunnel) {  // we have send it through an outbound tunnel\n          auto msg = CreateI2NPMessage(buf, kovri::core::GetI2NPMessageLength(buf), from);\n          tunnel-\u003eSendTunnelDataMsg(gateway_hash, gateway_tunnel, msg);\n        } else {\n          LOG(debug)\n            \u003c\u003c \"GarlicDestination: no outbound tunnels available for garlic clove\";\n        }\n        break;\n      }\n```\n\nImplications\n--------------\nSince the original message is allocated on the heap, this message can **leak massive amounts of heap data** to the receiving node (message lengths can be even 32KB). This data contains previous messages, currently treated messages, and many other sensitive data-structures of the I2P router.\n\nIn case there are any questions regarding my findings I will be more than happy to help.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-01-04T02:22:03.443Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-118930635.27907474,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":14,"voters":["jokebookservice1","heeeeen","corb3nik","theraz0r","soiax","ronak_9889","geeknik","eveeez","r3y","cr4xerbik4sh","and 4 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","score":7.7,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2171766,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi Eyal,\n\nFirstly, welcome to the Monero community - and thank you for your report! If I may ask, how did you find out about Kovri and HackerOne? We're glad to see you.\n\nSecondly, important disclaimers:\n\n- Kovri is pre-alpha, and pre-alpha for a reason. This is not my code nor have I given it my seal of approval. Much of Kovri development has been mostly rewriting the spaghetti code anti-pattern raw pointer nightmare of i2pd.\n- This is not the first time a raw leaks have arose from the pre-forked code nor will it be the last case until QA is complete. See [here](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/65), [here](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/64), and [here](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/commit/82650a25de708bd4cc34608cf200bb58fb2e42bc).\n- I have not ensured any QA on tunnel/I2NP as noted [in this issue](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/511) (garlic is implied though I should probably update the issue for verbosity) and, with the exception of at least two small commits, I've literally not done any *directly-related* work on the garlic implementation nor have I sat down with the implementation to make all the necessary changes.\n- Though I understand the appeal of your issue title, do note that:\n  - OpenSSL was initially released in 1998 and has had continous releases since then.\n  - OpenSSL has become the crux of the internet's security and safety backbone for what's possibly been trillions of dollars of e-commerce since browser https was first implemented.\n  - OpenSSL has had 100's if not 1000's of contributors/reviewers since 1998. Kovri has only 1 full-time developer since last year and only a handful of contributors.\n- Months ago, we discussed the need to have HackerOne reports for Kovri only apply to crypto and research because of the massive amount of known issues that have yet to be resolved e.g., if we release bounty for everyone of these kinds of reports, the bounty fund would go broke. These types reports are literally \"like shooting fish in a barrel\" because the code we forked from was so poorly designed and written - and there is still much more core code review needed. Unfortunately, this discussion never made it to HackerOne and there is still a [meta issue](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/83) for this.

Improvements are welcome.\n\n\u003eSending a specially crafted Garlic message can cause the router to send onward an I2P message containing leaked RAM data, triggering a massive information leakage.\n\nCan you provide a PoC exploit? Looking at this function alone and at no other controls, the potential leak is obvious - but ultimately the claim is still speculative. Without a PoC exploit, this report merely points out already-documented design issues. Also note that transport/tunnel/garlic message handling in I2P is convoluted and has many caveats. Though we could theoretically conjure any 2 byte size for payload length or any size \u003e actual clove length (and the memory does appear to be uninitialized), are you certain that no other checks are in place in any of the callers or clove creation functions? Hint: look in the surrounding areas around all calls to htobe16buf(buf, len). And, mind you, this would need to be exploited *before* payload hash is created or else verify will fail (AFAICT).\n\nThis report came at an odd time since I had plans to be AFK all week after Monday and, as such, I can't look further into the issue or even my own questions until the weekend or next Monday at the latest.

Such overflow will cause the size checks to pass with a possible length of ~0xFFFF.\n\nRegarding the PoC, since I didn't use a model to check my findings, I looked very carefully on all of the rellevant code. From the buffer allocation / free, to the entire message handling flow. In addition, this message was just decrypted and so no one else could have checked this length field before the vulnerable function. Again, I point to an attack by a node that properly signed and encrypted a hostile clove, and so the hash won't be a problem, nor does the message needs to be just as the source node should have created it.\n\nCode trail:\n* HandleAESBlock: decrypts into \"buf\" and advances it beyond the tags, key, hash and flags. Calls the payload handling with buf.\n* HandleGarlicPayload: parses \"num_cloves\" and runs in a loop to parse each clove from \"buf\". Creating the message according to the length field.\n* GetI2PMessageLength: bufbe16toh() + header size\n* bufbe16toh: be16toh(buf16toh(buf))\nAnd none of these last two function has any check / can validate this parsed value against the real message length. If the message length will be 1000 than even a length field of 2000 will leak ~1000 bytes and none of these functions can check it.\n\nLater on, inside CreateI2PMessage \"len\" just needs to be smaller the max message length of I2P, and the data will be copied to the buffer of the newly created message.\n\nP.S. I should prefer to demonstrate a full PoC but I don't think I have the knowledge needed to bring up a functioning model including two nodes properly communicating with each other.\n\nHope this answers the questions.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-11-21T08:12:20.410Z","updated_at":"2017-11-21T08:12:20.410Z","actor":{"username":"aerodudrizzt","cleared":false,"url":"/aerodudrizzt","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/098/646/ebd692682f9cff0731c0021d35f72330a3c88a8c_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"monero","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2181336,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"PoC\n====\nI managed to bring up a test environment, and added debug traces to the kovri router I compiled:\n* My traces starts with \"EI-DEBUG\"\n* After building the new I2NP message with the leaked information, I also traced the message according to it''s (hostile) length\nHere is the relevant (textual) trace:\n\n```\n[2017.11.24 22:56:53.218001] [0xb12f9b40] [debug]   GarlicDestination: 2 cloves\n[2017.11.24 22:56:53.218038] [0xb12f9b40] [debug]   GarlicDestination: Garlic type tunnel\n[2017.11.24 22:56:53.218074] [0xb12f9b40] [trace]   EI-DEBUG: eGarlicDeliveryTypeTunnel original length:1333\n[2017.11.24 22:56:53.218113] [0xb12f9b40] [trace]   EI-DEBUG: I2NPMessage using length:16400\n[2017.11.24 22:56:53.218152] [0xb12f9b40] [trace]   EI-DEBUG: PutI2NPMsg() with eGarlicDeliveryTypeTunnel:\n```\nSince the formatting of the markdown messes up the log traces, I uploaded it as a picture.

We specifically said *\"A scenario (and screenshot) has the potential to be manipulated to fit this control.

You had originally said *\"Sending a specially crafted Garlic message can cause the router to send onward an I2P message containing leaked RAM data, triggering a massive information leakage.\"* which implies that you were successfully able to do so. If you were successfully able to do so, you wouldn't need me to explain the code path as you would have demonstrated that you understood the components and concepts involved.\n\n2.

We simply corrected your invalid assumption that a CVE was required.\n\n\u003enow you request an additional code PoC that your fix does suffer from an IoF vulnerability, \n\nBy my patch you mean yours because ultimately what I provided is simple a wrapper for your patch... ?\n\n\u003eI just don't understand yet how the git dif on the attacker side will help you anyway.\n\nThen you don't understand how this network works.

At this point we would like to move on the following:\n\n1. Apply the single-line patch that you first proposed. Though the patch doesn't solve all problems of this area, this area of Kovri needs official review beyond the scope of this report.\n2. Because we have no official releases, the remaining portions of the Monero VRP after point 6 are not applicable. For internal use only, we will classify this issue as MEDIUM as defined in the Monero VRP: *\"or must be carefully exploited\"*.\n3. Give you credit in the git-log for your single-line patch. While your further work in this area will be appreciated, your patch is sufficient enough to close the report while we continue pre-Alpha development in this area. The remaining issues can be addressed with the TODOs in my patch. Any future related issues - while we're in pre-Alpha - can be resolved directly on github.\n4. Even though we don't intend to provide bounty before a Beta release, we will send you a complimentary XMR for your effort. Because HackerOne doesn't distribute XMR bounty through their service (and we don't offer fiat bounties), you will need to provide an XMR address for us to send XMR to (if you wish to have the bounty). Note: [this VRP caveat](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/issues/630) will be implemented effective immediately for future H1 issues (as I mentioned in my original response). Future bounty will also only be available (a much larger amount of bounty) after [this](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/83) is resolved.\n\n\nOn a sidenote: if you would like to make a steady, significant amount of XMR (either during our pre-Alpha and Alpha stages or beyond), you can create an [FFS proposal](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/63) to work part time on Kovri. For an example FFS proposal, see [here](https://forum.getmonero.org/9/work-in-progress/86967/anonimal-s-kovri-full-time-development-funding-thread).\n\nPlease feel free to ask any questions if any of the aforementioned was not clear.

The submission includes the entire project, including:\n* Full code for both routers (including the compiled binaries that I've used in my demo)\n* Configuration folders for each router - the setup was on an isolated test i2p network, with only these two nodes\n* Logs of both routers, produced during the exploit demonstration\n\nVulnerability Impact (Severity)\n---------------------------------\n* Since the vulnerability was demonstrated in a live setup, which you can re-create using the code PoC I attached, I ask that the ticket's description will reflect that the vulnerability is more than \"potential\".\n* Since this is an exploitable major information-leak I hope you will find it qualified to the 500 XMR minimum bounty you mentioned in your FFS.\n\nProposed Patch\n-----------------\nThe patch you proposed will indeed block the attack, more info can be found in the README.txt in the archive.\n\nLogistics:\n----------\nMy monero wallet address is:\n49q5B492UgjJMPQ3j2Zs246LzMmVvdNxoj3VGnBCQf2pAKt2rmQ6fag8jwFG7QUfmT1iDVmnmNVAUKNvNeYhYQxhCXeYRRE\nIn case there is any problem with it I will be more than happy to help.\n\nThanks for the very fast replies, especially relative to other bug bounty projects, and for the time you dedicated to my ticket.\nEyal Itkin.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-12-01T15:27:09.539Z","updated_at":"2017-12-01T15:27:09.539Z","actor":{"username":"aerodudrizzt","cleared":false,"url":"/aerodudrizzt","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/098/646/ebd692682f9cff0731c0021d35f72330a3c88a8c_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"monero","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2195112,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\u003eMy full documented test setup can be found in an encrypted compressed zip folder in my website\n\nPlease don't link to your website.

You cannot reproduce the network with simply two nodes. I can't verify if you indeed only used two nodes (see above about uploading files) but if you wish to prove this issue as *not* potential, you'll need to make your case using real tunnels with real hops - preferably using the testnet we already have in place (modifications are welcome).\n\n\u003eSince this is an exploitable major information-leak I hope you will find it qualified to the 500 XMR minimum bounty you mentioned in your FFS\n\nI'm afraid you're terribly confused. 500 XMR was for the minimum bounty **fund** - not for a minimum bug bounty **payout**. Nowhere in the FFS does it state that a *single* bug will be rewarded 500 XMR. In fact, nowhere in our policy or VRP does it state that any pre-Alpha kovri bug will receive *any* XMR. This is because we've only recently started using HackerOne and had yet to finish working out [the details](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/pull/142).

The vulnerability I found is a trivial code vulnerability and not a protocol vulnerability. This means that by definition the size of the network means nothing - as any rogue user on the network with a modified client can trigger the execution. The size of the network simply doesn't mean anything.\n\n1. This is one of the first projects I encounter that not only has no clear guidelines on how much are different bugs worth, but you also acknowledge yourself that the bounty definitions are not explicit and therefore you actually edited the description text while we were working on this bug: [Monero HackerOne policy change](https://hackerone.com/monero/policy_versions?change=3564319#), [Kovri bounty readme policy change](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/commit/4ae89fc5ae002a08e1ecb44b201caf2e3ca34899), [Monero projects bug bounty declaration]( https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/39#issuecomment-289310019). I think that this acknowledgement does mean that there is a problem here at least to some extent.\n\n1. In order for future researchers (not only me) to know we are putting our efforts towards the benefits of the project in an ideal way, it would help if you would respond on what you actually need for it to be considered a PoC. In the comment on November 28 I outlined what I were proposing for the PoC (setting up a rouge client and router which enables the vulnerability to be easily seen). At no point whatsoever you said it's insufficient (due to network size) - you only said that after I already had put a significant amount of time on showing that.\n\n    To some extent, when a researcher is working to improve your project and describes in advance what and how he is going to provide, any reservation to the proposed PoC method shall be defined in advance rather than \"that this is not enough\", once the work is already done.\n\n    As long as I don't get clear definitive criterias on what needs to be done to prove the vulnerability, I have no reason to continue working on this. So far you did not show that you tried verifying that the PoC code works. Your offer of 1 XMR for this entire effort is simply not respecting the time I have put so far nor your published policy.\n\n1. I do believe that at this point it should be trivial to any core worker on the project to reproduce this on the test network. I'd be more than happy to provide any help you need and answer questions, but at this point what remains is engineering testing to verify the required fix on the network and not a security research.\n\n    Just for a reference, i2pd needed less than 12 hours from my report on this issue, to realize the problem and deploy a fix - so if you don't want to build the setup yourself, you can probably rely on the good folks there to see the vulnerability is real. Their fix can be tracked using CVE 2017-17066, and it will be published soon under version 2.17.\n\n1. The code PoC was uploaded as an encrypted archive to my site since it is unresponsible for any security researcher to uploaded a full exploit script into a ticket that might be publicly published someday. The archive was encrypted with a password that I gave you, such that your project would be able to use the PoC and not everyone on the internet. Once you confirm that you have downloaded my test environment I can remove it from my website, so the exploit won't be available to third parties from harming unpatched clients while the vulnerability will be a 1-day. Please explain why this form of submission has any accountability problems.\n\n1. Finally, it's unfortunate the guidelines regarding the part that my report is not \"bounty worth\" were blurry and that it was further updated after my report. I think there's real justification to reward my work per the published information as I showed in the above links.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-12-02T11:17:54.722Z","updated_at":"2017-12-02T11:17:54.722Z","actor":{"username":"aerodudrizzt","cleared":false,"url":"/aerodudrizzt","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/098/646/ebd692682f9cff0731c0021d35f72330a3c88a8c_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"monero","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2200742,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::CommentsClosed","message":"\u003eThe vulnerability I found is a trivial code vulnerability and not a protocol vulnerability.\n\nNo one contested this.\n\n\u003eThis means that by definition the size of the network means nothing - as any rogue user on the network with a modified client can trigger the execution. The size of the network simply doesn't mean anything.\n\n1. Interesting, because earlier you had said `After all we both want to know that the vulnerability is indeed exploitable, and a code PoC is the best way for it.` So, since you refuse to attach PoC exploit code to this issue, how can either of those statements have be validated (rhetorical question)?\n\n\u003eThe vulnerability I found is a trivial code vulnerability and not a protocol vulnerability. This means that by definition the size of the network means nothing\n\n1. Yes, trivial code vulnerability. Yes, not a protocol vulnerability. No, size matters. If a vulnerability **requires** tunnels to first be built using a tunnel pool built from a set of routers, this requires a myriad of other checks and factors to successfully pass throughout tunnel/I2NP and transports which, in this case, would need to pass messages of certain sizes. Since we haven't implemented 0 hop tunnels yet, your test setup sounds very inaccurate. Again, I cannot confirm because you've refused to upload PoC to HackerOne.\n\n2. Again, I've never claimed that this wasn't a vulnerability nor that it wasn't exploitable but since you kept making demands that X was Y, I asked that you prove Y, not X. A simple code-diff would've proven the claim but instead you've chosen to run around in circles.\n\n\u003eThis is one of the first projects I encounter that not only has no clear guidelines on how much are different bugs worth\n\n1. Monero is not a company nor is it a government entity. Monero is built entirely by the community. Monero is not governed by any single person. This also applies to Kovri. If you want to add guidelines, then add them.\n\n2. Monero developers have realized that there time is more fruitfully spent being paid for actual work instead of ad-hoc bug-bounty hunting. If you need a more granular tier, contribute to the open pull request that I linked above.\n\n\u003eYour offer of 1 XMR for this entire effort is simply not respecting the time I have put so far nor your published policy.\n\nYou've not respected your own time by making assumptions instead of doing basic research. You haven't asked questions nor have you become involved with the community. In this report, you've only asked one question! Look at your responses! **All this whining and complaining... and demanding any bug-bounty reward for a one-line patch to unreleased pre-Alpha software in an area that has yet to undergo official QA - it's laughable!**.\n\nIf you're ever unsure about your \"reward\", look at a project's policy before reporting. If what you desire is not explicitly noted then ask questions and get involved before living on assumptions. How foolish to do otherwise. Never in our VRP was a bounty amount of any kind ever explicitly stated. This was because we had yet to collaborate on the question of bounty. Now that we bounty in place, once the aforementioned PR is merged, you and everyone else can benefit from a wealth of bounty potential.\n\n\u003eThe code PoC was uploaded as an encrypted archive to my site since it is unresponsible for any security researcher to uploaded a full exploit script into a ticket that might be publicly published someday. The archive was encrypted with a password that I gave you, such that your project would be able to use the PoC and not everyone on the internet. \n\n**This is exactly why HackerOne was invented**: to protect their users from each other and to act as a mitigating entity between two or more parties. If you don't want to **use** HackerOne, then don't use it! Ironically, anonymity networks defend against the very targeted surveillance that you are endorsing we succumb to.\n\n\u003eless than 12 hours from my report on this issue, to realize the problem and deploy a fix\n\n1. Interesting, earlier you said `Thanks again for your attention and fast response.`\n\n2. You submitted your report over the weekend. The VRP specifically says \"no more than 3 working days\". If you don't understand what most of the world understands as \"working days\" (no one else has misunderstood), then I can't help you.\n\n3. To quote myself, because you continue to slide this discussion: `This report came at an odd time since I had plans to be AFK all week after Monday and, as such, I can't look further into the issue or even my own questions until the weekend or next Monday at the latest. Despite being pre-alpha, without a release, and the lack of a PoC exploit, a patch should be applied regardless - so I will check-in this week before the weekend to ensure that this issue is resolved in a timely manner.` And it has been resolved in a timely manner. **Read the VRP**. These are industry-standard bullet points.\n\n\u003egood folks\n\nWas that before or after they watermarked their routers for months after releasing (rhetorical question)?\n\n\u003eto see the vulnerability is real.\n\nNo one contested that the vulnerability wasn't real. For the Nth time, for this report, said reality of functional exploitation has yet to be proven with a HackerOne attached code PoC exploit. As discussed earlier, we both addressed the need for the patch and that it should be promptly applied. **The patch was promptly applied, and this is no longer an issue**. Have you actually read anything I've written in any detail (rhetorical question)?\n\nAs promised, we will send the 1 XMR to the address you gave and, as promised, we will send the transaction this week. Should you be interested, links to find various market values are in the aforementioned VRP github PR link.\n\nGet involved in the community: the Monero community is large and growing. We can help you understand the value of cryptocurrency. Visit us on IRC or on /r/Monero if you have any further questions.\n\nTo clarify, again: this issue is no longer an issue and thus will be locked. Defer to github for any subsequent pre-Alpha reports and the VRP for bounty details.\n\nHappy hacking!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-12-05T01:21:32.280Z","updated_at":"2017-12-05T01:21:32.280Z","actor":{"url":"/monero","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/007/731/55634f7fcd917725c7a5771cc6e7c9b4d5fe0c22_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Monero"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"monero","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2200820,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"JFTR:\n\n\u003eWas that before or after they watermarked their routers for months after releasing (rhetorical question)?\n\nThis is in reference to a pre-Kovri incident where they argued *against* the dangers of raw-memory leaks.
