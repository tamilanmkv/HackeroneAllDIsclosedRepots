At HackerOne, we use a library that consolidates authorization, input validation, and business logic into a single layer that lies directly under our controllers. This allows us to route API calls, GraphQL queries / mutations, and normal endpoints to that layer and know for sure that the authorization is always checked. However, it turns out that the input validation was sometimes bloated with business logic. Because the input validation is executed **before** the authorization logic, it would return error messages that revealed information about the report. Here's a code example:\n\n**Wrong**\n```ruby\nclass AwardBountyClass\n  def initialize(report_id)\n    # store the report_id in the class instance\n  end\n\n  def authorized?\n    # make sure user can award a bounty\n  end\n\n  def validate\n    # make sure report_id is an integer\n    # return an error when the balance is too low\n  end\n\n  def execute\n    # award the bounty\n  end\nend\n```\n\n**Good**\n```ruby\nclass AwardBountyClass\n  def initialize(report_id)\n    # store the report_id in the class instance\n  end\n\n  def authorized?\n    # make sure user can award a bounty\n  end\n\n  def validate\n    # make sure report_id is an integer\n  end\n\n  def execute\n    # return an error when the balance is too low\n    # award the bounty\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe difference between the two is that the error **should** be returned in the `execute` method, not the `validate` method. We've identified multiple code structures in our code base where this could've happened and addressed those. We took the learnings from your report and will see if we can automate the detection of these incorrect code structures.

again!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-11-28T23:58:46.778Z","updated_at":"2017-11-28T23:58:46.778Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2188092,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I
