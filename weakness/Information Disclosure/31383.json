Similarly if I set `common_response_id` to **18**, I get a trigger title of ████████ in the trigger (refer screenshots).This certainly seems to be of some other team.\n\n**JSON (which gives trigger title as ████████):**\n`{\"title\":\"hackerone\",\"criteria\":[{\"field\":\"any\",\"type\":\"inclusion\",\"inverse\":false,\"data\":\"agfagasga\"}],\"actions\":[{\"type\":\"request-needs-more-info\",\"common_response_id\":24}],\"disabled\":false}`\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\n1. Login to Program/Team Dashboard \n2. Goto https://hackerone.com/\u003cteam-name\u003e/triggers/new\n3. Leave all options default and add text to criteria and select any common response.\n4. Start the intercepting proxy and configure it to intercept the request\n5. Now add title and enable the trigger then hit **Save**\n6. Modify `common_response_id` to 24 for ████████ title or 18 for ████████ title\n\nKindly refer to screenshots as well.Revert back if you have any further query.\n\nThanks,\nPrakhar Prasad","bounty_amount":"1000.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,000","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-11-14T10:55:38.815Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-218000885.01137596,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":6,"voters":["sw33tlie","realtess","madrobot","japz","spetr0x","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":142440,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"We can confirm this issue, and we'll get it fixed ASAP.
