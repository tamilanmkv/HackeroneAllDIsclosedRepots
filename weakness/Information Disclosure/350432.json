Very valuable info for later stages.\n2. When user is not logged in and loads some json endpoint that requires user authentication, http 400 code will be returned. That causes attacking `\u003cimg\u003e` tag not to be loaded e.g. timing attack to make it impossible =\u003e we can remote determine if user is logged in on HackerOne or not. Very valuable info for later stages.\n3. Even if this \"issue\" is solved e.g. api returns http 200, there are always handy http 500 status codes e.g. if we know some endpoint that returns http 500 for request where user need to be logged in, then we have our marker. Try adding `%00` as value in `subject` parameter.\n    \nNew timing attack technique towards JSON endpoints - current connection speed towards not CSRF protected json endpoint\n\nWhy only JSON endpoints - HTML tags will add extra noice to the response and will add extra deviation towards final approximation of the final results. JSON holds adds minimum noise in the results.\n\nHow timing attack works\nOn the attacker end - offline\n1. Need to have HackerOne profile in order to find vulnerable endpoints\n2. Need to find 3 interesting endpoints with the following characteristics:\n     2.1 Endpoint that holds valuable data as number of triaged + critical reports where report id nolds XYZTRA numbers ( you can determine time of the report via report id ) (https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?text_query=4\u0026subject=\u0026sort_type=pg_search_rank\u0026substates%5B%5D=triaged)\n     2.2 Endpoint that returns minimal response and could be considered equal with empty response (https://hackerone.com/bugs.json?text_query=999999\u0026subject=\u0026sort_type=pg_search_rank\u0026substates%5B%5D=triaged)\n     2.3 Endpoint that will hold decent amount of data (~10KB) and that data is not changed very often in order to eliminate/lower server side processing difference from the equation (https://hackerone.com/programs/search.json?query=IBB\u0026sort=published_at%3Adescending\u0026page=1)\n3. Minimal 2.2 and targeted 2.1 endpoints need to have same/similar server side complexity ( 2.1 with empty `text_query` is much faster than 2.2. with `text_query = 999999999` )\n4. On stable and descent internet connection calculate the following:\n    4.1 Average time of loading 2.2 and 2.3\n    4.2 AVG_TIME(2.3) - AVG_TIME(2.2) = AVG_TIME_DATA_ONLY(2.3)\n    4.3 SPEED_ME (B per ms) = (SIZE(2.3) - SIZE(2.2))/AVG_TIME_DATA_ONLY(2.3) is the speed towards HackerOne infrastructure\n    4.4 Monitoring many different responses with the same form as 2.1 we can calculate each json record average size - we can call it ONE_JSON ~ 850B ( this calculation must be based from the response side perspective due the fact it is traveling gzip-ed )\n    4.5 Calculate the average time of loading 2.1 AVG_TIME(2.1) and AVG_TIME(2.1) - AVG_TIME(2.2) = AVG_TIME_DATA_ONLY(2.1)\n    4.6  SPEED_ME * AVG_TIME_DATA_ONLY(2.1)  = SIZE_DATA_ONLY(2.1) and if you divide with ONE_JSON it will give number of records.\n\nOn the attacking web server:\n1. Victim need to be measured only towards 2 endpoints:\n 1.1 Towards 2.3 endpoint (no need of 2.1, but those bonus info would make calculations more precise)\n 1.2 Towards attacking endpoint\n2. Results of measurement will be then send towards attacker server for later processing\n3. Attack could start after attacker will make sure victim is already logged in on H1.\n4. With dumped results we can measure victim speed ( simple proportion in this case or repeating above procedure ) and based on the speed we can derive conclusions regarding endpoint that is under attack.\n5. All of this could be performed offline (clean up results even by hand due the fact 25+ requests per endpoint give perfect insight).\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Use scripts from 348168 report in order to harvest the data for calculations\n2. Use only 1.php and 3.php to collect victims benchmarks \n3. Proportion between 2.3 average load time ( you - attacker and victim ) will give you insight regarding his speed. Then jump towards calculations above\n\n### Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)\n\n * \n\n### Optional: Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)\n\n *\n\n## Impact\n\nCounting number of reports with any property from `search filters` on HackerOne in certain time interval (report id)","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":4701,"original_report_url":"https://hackerone.com/reports/4701","attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":6,"voters":["ali","diklabarda","realtess","cr4xerbik4sh","cryptographer","reppie"],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":2.9,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"local","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2731459,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Hi @slavco - thanks, but how is this different from #348168?","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-05-11T21:20:33.684Z","updated_at":"2018-05-11T21:20:33.684Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2731466,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Just better written I already mentioned in the last coment on the another one and I have calculated the impact clicking on the wizzard.

Weird values are cases when some requests are longer or slower than another and simple average calculation fails. As I already said before all of this could be skipped if simple result cleaning is performed ( yes attack works offline too ), so let me show you how to do that.\n\nOne of the bad results is shown {F297230}\nIts visual representation is the following {F297231}\nFrom this image is more than obvious that we can add the following constraints towards average calculations in order to get good results:\n1. Big request - green \u003e 1600\n2. Small request - red \u003c 750\n3. Attack endpoint - yellow \u003c 900  \nNow with this constraints we have our results {F297232} and {F297233}\n\nYou can try the same technique on the PoC scripts I already sent to you.\nImportant: Those good results are achieved with average calculation and data sets of 30 requests per endpoint loaded from the browser at the same time (could be measured request by request too, then results will be much more precise). I have already mentioned that for remote attacker there is scenario where minimum benchmark and attacking endpoint benchmark are needed.\n\nThat is it, now you have clear insight regarding effectiveness of this attack. Regarding data that could be learned I have already said that any important count from search filter with time time constraints provided by report_id and will be executed only against logged in users on HackerOne that visit attacker web.\n
