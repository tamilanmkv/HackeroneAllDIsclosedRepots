I got curious when I saw one of the [brew bottle builds](https://jenkins.brew.sh/job/Homebrew%20Bottles/33255/console) doing a `git push` to BrewTestBot/homebrew-core, and wondered if the credentials to make authenticated pushes were accessible.\n\nSure enough, you can view environment variables for the build on [this page](https://jenkins.brew.sh/job/Homebrew%20Bottles/33255/injectedEnvVars/), which includes a `HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable.\n\nThis API token belongs to the [BrewTestBot](https://github.com/BrewTestBot) user on GitHub, and this API key allows me to commit to the `BrewTestBot/homebrew-core` repository:\n\n```\n$ export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=\u003cgithub token from above\u003e\n$ curl https://api.github.com/repos/BrewTestBot/homebrew-core/git/blobs -u $GITHUB_API_TOKEN:x-oauth-basic -d '{\"content\":\"test\"}' -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n{\n  \"sha\": \"30d74d258442c7c65512eafab474568dd706c430\",\n  \"url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/BrewTestBot/homebrew-core/git/blobs/30d74d258442c7c65512eafab474568dd706c430\"\n}\n```\n\n## Impact\n\nBased on the purpose of `BrewTestBot`, this might be entirely intended, but if the GitHub access token has overly permissive scopes, it might be usable to perform other actions, aside from a `git push`.

This assumes that the `master` branch on these repos does not have branch protection + required reviews, meaning I would be able to fast-forward `refs/heads/master`.\n\n### 1) Replacing bin/brew\n\nThe installation instructions on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) document the recommended method for installing homebrew as:\n\n```console\n/usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\"\n```\n\nThis downloads and evaluates the Ruby script found at https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/master/install.\n\nThe ruby script does a few things, one of which is to [clone the master branch of https://github.com/Homebrew/brew into `/usr/local/Homebrew`](https://github.com/Homebrew/install/blob/052743dae1c004829c02e1a7c0b4aa82eff18846/install#L326-L362).\n\n```ruby\nsystem git, \"config\", \"remote.origin.url\", BREW_REPO\nsystem git, \"config\", \"remote.origin.fetch\", \"+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*\"\n\n# ensure we don't munge line endings on checkout\nsystem git, \"config\", \"core.autocrlf\", \"false\"\n\nargs = git, \"fetch\", \"origin\", \"master:refs/remotes/origin/master\",\n       \"--tags\", \"--force\"\nsystem(*args)\n\nsystem git, \"reset\", \"--hard\", \"origin/master\"\n```\n\nGiven that this clones the `master` branch, If I were able to fast-forward `refs/heads/master`, I could have committed a backdoored version of [bin/brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/bin/brew). The next time someone downloaded/updated homebrew, I would have control of their machine.\n\n#### 2) Replacing formulae\n\nGiven this also granted commit access to Homebrew/homebrew-core, I could have replaced the formula for any package with a backdoored version of it. The next time someone installs the package, I would have control of their machine.\n\n---\n\nI think the severity of this ultimately rests on whether or not I would have been able to fast-forward the master branches on either repo. It looks like Homebrew/brew might have branch protection + required reviews, but it seems like Homebrew/homebrew-core does not, meaning I would have been able to replace formula.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-01T01:38:26.336Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T01:38:26.336Z","actor":{"username":"ejholmes","cleared":false,"url":"/ejholmes","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/160/627/92f28d0b4c250aed2b781af48097552c8f9413ed_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"homebrew","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3126661,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Homebrew/brew has had protected branches and required reviews so this was never possible there.

As a long time user of Homebrew, I appreciate the amount of effort you and the rest of the team have put in to making Homebrew what it is today.\n\nHowever, I think it’s important to note that if this was leaked without being disclosed by the Homebrew team, it would look a lot worse than just saying “Here’s what happened, it wasn’t used maliciously. We screwed up because we’re human, we’ll do better”. For something like this, I would recommend a public disclosure from Homebrew, ideally including proof that this wasn’t used maliciously.\n\nI think this can be used to draw more support to the needs of Homebrew; given how popular it is, and the potential impact of a vulnerability like this, a lot more resources could be devoted to improving security for Homebrew. If this draws the attention of something like the Project Zero team at Google, that might mean an overall better and more secure tool for users. I think this also highlights a fundamental flaw in the industry where we put a lot of implicit trust in package managers to be perfect, which ends up leading to a massively large attack vector for backdoors; NPM, RubyGems, PyPi and the like have all had and will have very similar vulnerabilities to this.\n\nI’ll be drafting the blog post over the next few weeks, and I’ll give you a chance to review it before I publish (and after you’re back from paternity leave).","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-01T14:22:12.442Z","updated_at":"2018-08-01T14:22:12.442Z","actor":{"username":"ejholmes","cleared":false,"url":"/ejholmes","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/160/627/92f28d0b4c250aed2b781af48097552c8f9413ed_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"homebrew","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3129302,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for that.

More than happy to review your draft when you have it.\n\nAlso, if I can make a few recommendations, here's a few things that would be worth doing (if they haven't already been done), and included in the public disclosure.\n\n1. Enable the \"Require 2FA\" setting on the Homebrew org: https://github.com/organizations/Homebrew/settings/security. This wouldn't have prevented the issue at hand, but could help prevent another similar attack (e.g. see the recent [Gentoo GitHub breach](https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/github-hacking-gentoo-linux.html)). It would probably be a good idea to also vocalize to any members of the Homebrew team to not use SMS based 2FA (see the [Reddit breach](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) today). The Reddit disclosure is also a really great example of a good disclosure (What happened, What's the impact, What we're doing).\n2. Enable third party app restrictions for the Homebrew org: https://github.com/organizations/Homebrew/settings/oauth_application_policy. This will help ensure that, if any Homebrew members OAuth with some mom-and-pop app, those API keys won't be usable on the Homebrew/* repos. Like the above, this wouldn't have prevented this issue, but it can prevent a similar one in the future.\n3. Enable branch protection + required reviews on any core Homebrew repos that don't have it (e.g. `Homebrew/homebrew-core`, `Homebrew/homebrew-cask`, `Homebrew/brew.sh`), and audit the number of people that have \"admin\" rights on the repos so this can't be bypassed.\n4. Have all the Homebrew org members review their personal access tokens and prune anything that's not used: https://github.com/settings/tokens\n\nThere's probably a broader discussion that could be had on how the brew client could be made to put less trust in the `Homebrew/homebrew-core` repo and GitHub, like using GPG signing, but those are probably discussions that would need to happen elsewhere.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-02T01:19:07.066Z","updated_at":"2018-08-02T01:24:54.168Z","actor":{"username":"ejholmes","cleared":false,"url":"/ejholmes","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/160/627/92f28d0b4c250aed2b781af48097552c8f9413ed_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"homebrew","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3131266,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks! \n\n1.
