The link to download the report will be returned in the response location header.\n\n-----\n\n**How you grab Report data even after company removed you**\n\n- If Publisher/Company invite you for their MoPub Account with any permissions \u0026 Roles.\n (\"administrators or Members\" - it doesn't matter, which permission company gives you while invitation)\n\n- After accept the invitation you have access to make all changes to the company account. \n\n-----\n\n**Attacking approach start from here**\n\n- In order to retrieve data, the API must first be enabled for company account.\n- So, you can Enable data access through API (just click on checkbox in the Reports page of the MoPub UI.)\nor it might be already enabled by publisher.\n- Note down the \"Reporting API access details\". [i.e. API key, Inventory report ID, Campaign report ID]\n- Also Note the Report ID of each MoPub Report present inside the Company Account.\n\n**!!!**\n\n- Now, the publisher/company doesn't want you with their MoPub account and they removed you from their Manage User settings.\n- But they forgot to Reset API key.\n- Now, you don't have any access of company account. \n\n\u003e NOTE! **You have the \"Reporting API access details (which you noted)\".**\n\n-----\n\n**Access the Reporting API :**\n\n- GET request using the request parameters.\n\n[report_key=[individual_report_id ; inventory_report_id ; campaign_report_id]\napi_key=[API_KEY]\ndate=Date of the report. Format YYYY-MM-DD]\nhttps://app.mopub.com/reports/custom/api/download_report?report_key=[REP_KEY]\u0026api_key=[API_KEY]\u0026date=[YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n- Sample Request:\n\n██████████\n\n-----\n\n##Remediation :\n\n1. API key must be auto-reset after the user removed from company.\n2. **(for 2nd condition in impact)** Once the Data access is disabled, user should not be able to access reports data via API.\n\n\n.\n\n\n**Thank you : )**\n\n## Impact\n\n- Attacker(removed user) able to access Organization Current as well as in Future created MoPub reports in 2 conditions :\n\n1. If API key is not reset and \"data access through API\" checkbox is enabled \n2. If API key is not reset and \"data access through API\" checkbox is disabled.","bounty_amount":"140.0","formatted_bounty":"$140","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-12-02T20:17:11.618Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-58646339.08050332,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":11,"voters":["ali","elmahdi","exception","sa1tama0","cryptographer","rudvan88","seebluecat","newfile","supernintenden","michaelsdavid","and 1 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":1074,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"mopub.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3260144,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your report.\n\nWe are considering this, and we'll keep you updated when we have additional information.\n\nThank you for thinking of Twitter security.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-28T21:06:12.621Z","updated_at":"2018-08-28T21:06:12.621Z","actor":{"username":"bugtriage-michael","cleared":false,"url":"/bugtriage-michael","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3270411,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report.
