A staff member having no explicit permissions on a Shopify Store may be able to  retrieve the Current balances in all currencies for the account for Shopify Payments.\n\n__Steps__\n\n1. STAFF account is created and assigned NO permissions on a Shop by Owner/Admin\n2. STAFF then logs in to shop. Notice that STAFF is not having any access to menus/ HOME section.\n{F353946}\n\n3.

The response indicated that the store is using `shopifyPayments` as means of settling payouts between customers, merchants \u0026 store owners. This information should have been hidden since the STAFF running the GraphQL query had no `settings` permission assigned to his role. This means STAFF must ideally not know what is/are the payment providers which are applicable for the store.\n\n2. The response indicates an array called `balances` which I think is the place holder to retrieve the Current balances in all currencies for the account used for Shopify Payments on the store. Since my store did not do any transactions, the array is left empty. I suspect that had there been any Shopify Payments transactions in store, the balance of those will be reflected back into the `balances` parameter in the above GraphQL response. I believe payments/billing related information must not be visible/displayed to the STAFF especially when he has `no- explicit` permission assigned on the store.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information

But would you please care to explain why this was lowered to a LOW issue?\n\nI actually thought this would have been worth a little more since you right mentioned that this falls into the category of \"Circumvention of user permission model\". The STAFF member over here was not assigned literally no permissions at all and yet he was able to view `Shopify Payments` balance of store. Had a STAFF had some sort of permission(s) other than `Settings` permission and was able to to view the balances would make the report fall into the bucket of this being rewarded with a minimum bounty but since the STAFF had no permissions what so ever and still was able to fetch payment balances IMO bumps up the severity to a MEDIUM at least.\n\nAt the end, I respect Shopify's decision but just wanted to voice out my opinion regarding the severity. Thanks anyways and wish you all a Merry Christmas \u0026 Happy New Year!!\n\nCheers,\n@h13- ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-12-19T17:09:20.098Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T17:09:20.098Z","actor":{"username":"h13-","cleared":false,"url":"/h13-","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/018/910/09de946f9c4ce6668fc07f4613a450177f4c430d_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"shopify","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3867827,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\u003e The STAFF member over here was not assigned literally no permissions at all\n\nThe permissions control access to certain parts of the admin panel; other parts of it are intentionally accessible to all staff members.
