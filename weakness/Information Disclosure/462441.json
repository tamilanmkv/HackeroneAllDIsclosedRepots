However, I believe that by default data shall NOT be publicly available. This would be also a first mitigation against point B.2 stated below.\n\n# B) preventing data loss\n## 1. lock\n NC app should not sync if lock is set up. This goes against the  lock features, doesn't it? At least for data integrity protection through the upload to server\n\n## 2. data modification \nPreventing undesired app to trigger data loss is just vital for users that uses Nextcloud sever as a primary storage. I know  companies that use Nextcloud (based on my recommendations :D) but because of these issues, I would not recommend them to install Android app unless I give clear setup instructions and review these with them (e.g. access to shared contact only and sync with Davdroid).\n \nNote that regarding this \"storage on public folder\", I could here refine the issue in 2 points:\n* 2.1 data explicitly saved locally on public folder.\n* 2.2 data NON explicitly saved locally but just opened \n\nFor 2.1, unless stated that choosing /sdcard folder allows other apps to (read and) alter NC server of locally saved content, NC app should ask user confirmation before syncing back to server \n\nfor 2.2, shouldn't NC use a private folder as here we are more talking of a cache feature than a real storage one? Data opened in NC becomes basically readable by any apps. As storage on private folder works very well on NC app, I believe that 2.2 case should be handled within private folder and through FileProvider \"framework\" (as you have for private storage file management).\n\n# C) Regarding nc keypairs\n I see app was updated on store on December 23, 2018. So probably the keys are a leftover as the app was installed before.

Nextcloud is a file sync and share solution. If other apps can't access the data at all there is very little use in setting up the android app to begin with. Regarding the overwriting of files. Nextcloud has versioning by default. And as always regular backups of your server are important. For example the same attacks hold true if you are on the desktop client.\n\nRegarding 1. This was not what the lock feature was designed for originally. The original idea was that users could not modify server config. Initiate shares etc. But I'll discuss with Tobias what we think falls under this. Because I do not feel a lot for asking 20 random files that are edited since the last tie if they should be uploaded. Then disabling syncing when the lock is enabled makes most sense.\n\nAbout asking the user to sync back (2.1). I do not think this is a workable solution. A lot of our background jobs are controled by the Android OS. So the app might come at a completely different time asking you if you want to sync back file x/y/z.txt. In which case the user might have already forgotten in. Here it might be possible to maye show a 1 time warning the first time you enable syncing?\n\nWhat might be a possible enhancement that when a user sets up the lock that they are also asked if they want to move their files to protected storage. that would not kill all the usability of the app by default while still giving people that want to lock their account a bit more control.\n\nI'll discuss some of this with Tobias over a beer and we'll get back to you.\n\nCheers,\n--Roeland","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eHi Julien,\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile I understand your concerns.
