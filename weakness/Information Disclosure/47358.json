If I get this right, you can check wether a user exists and whether a specific SIM card id is linked to it. \nI believe we can check whether an username exists (is already taken) upon the registration process. I'm also not too sure whether we consider the sim card ID as specific information - it's just an identifier. Could you maybe provide some more information on this one? Can you, for example, link the SIM id to a telephone number (I would consider that to be an issue), or do you see any further security implications in the username disclosure?\n\nThanks\n\nInti","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-02-10T22:49:45.142Z","updated_at":"2015-02-10T22:49:45.142Z","actor":{"username":"intidc","cleared":true,"url":"/intidc","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/002/322/cb30ac31b7653e73d6dd5a0f0e2cfeed113d2feb_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"mobilevikings","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":329539,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\"Can you, for example, link the SIM id to a telephone number\" -\u003e https://hackerone.com/reports/47362\nMay this is not a security issue.
