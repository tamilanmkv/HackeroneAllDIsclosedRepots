For example for this challenge: █████ the name of the target is not disclosed anywhere and the page looks something like this: \n\n█████\n\nHowever, once we import the calendar on something like Google calendar, it shows the name of the target: \n\n█████████\n\nThis is super useful specially because sometimes program run multiple challenges in short period of time. For example, knowing more about this challenge (the name of the target), a hacker can hack and hodl bugs until the program starts. \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Add yourself to challenge like the one linked above.\n2. Link/update your Google Calendar with the hackerone events calendar.\n3. Find the date in the calendar when the challenge is set to start and you can see the name there.\n\n## Impact\n\nDisclosure of h1c-* challenge targets.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-03-01T21:49:51.829Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-82487726.29989125,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":28,"voters":["kapytein","bl4de","sameerphad72","spam404","s_p_q_r","mik317","dhakal_ananda","realtess","r3y","an0nym0us","and 18 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":3.8,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4065494,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks for your report, we’re looking into it!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-01-30T16:38:23.584Z","updated_at":"2019-01-30T16:38:23.584Z","actor":{"username":"bencode","cleared":false,"url":"/bencode","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/013/117/ddaa1da4e004e1234c6857c42f9bfa8df85b5ccf_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4065738,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the triage @bencode and also thank you for making this cool feature.
