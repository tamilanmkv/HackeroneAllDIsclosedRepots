Essentially, it has to do with website behavior towards empty host headers. So the original method comprises of setting up a GET request to the website, just the main directory. Next, you test it for typical host header injection by changing the Host header to anything like foo.com. Send this request, and if the response contains foo.com anywhere, it may be vulnerable to blank host header info. leakage. However when I was testing your site, I noticed it simply gave a 302 and tried to redirect back to the correct host. I found a way to bypass this though; setting up the request to a nonexistent directory, and including the CR character, like this: /foo%0A, makes it give a 404 and return the host header at the bottom of the page.\n\nNow that we have host header injection, here's where you use that to leak the internal information. Firstly, change the protocol from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/1.0 (this is to allow blank host headers). Next, remove the host header and send the request. Look in the same spot that the host header was displayed previously, and the internal hostname/ip will be displayed there.\n\nSuggested Remediation\nTo prevent this, you need to prevent host header injection, or at least prevent the host header from being returned anywhere in the response.\n\nThe best way to do this is using something like Cloudfront protection, which prevents host header injection.\n\nImpact\nIt is a bad idea to leak internal hostnames, as they can be used by attackers to exploit the network or server. They can chain issues to launch specific attacks against the internal infrastructure; in other words, leaking internal IPs or hostnames leads to normally non-issues becoming vulnerabilities.","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false,"attachments":[],"user":{"id":693290,"username":"volcanic82","name":"volcanic82","bio":"","cleared":false,"website":null,"location":"","created_at":"2019-07-30T21:11:25.957Z","url":"https://hackerone.com/volcanic82","anc_triager":false,"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null,"user_type":"hacker","profile_picture_urls":{"small":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png","medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png","xtralarge":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"}}},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
