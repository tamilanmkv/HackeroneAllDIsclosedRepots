This vulnerability can allow the attacker to access resources internal to the network, which would otherwise be inaccessible.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerablity also allows the use of another attack, a Cross Site Port Attack (XSPA), which allows an attacker to basically do a port scan from the context of the server host.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerablity lies in the webhooks functionality of a dropbox developer app and already has basic protection of this, as shown by the following  error message:\r\n\r\n    Webhooks doesn't support localhost as Dropbox can't contact your local server. Please use an internet accessible URI.\r\n\r\nAfter some testing, I have found that the webhook allow IP6 addresses through, allowing me to determine that there is an ssh server running on either the webhook machine, or the outgoing web proxy machine. This server has the following version:\r\n\r\n    SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1\r\n\r\nThe webhook URL used to gain this information was ```http://[::1]:22/```, which produces the following output:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nError: Incorrect response to challenge. We didn't receive the expected response vLU7VauagR860z2P2sNTZkSNFJvdjt3zJ-qfZP1yIGU. See the actual response body we received below.\r\n\r\nRequest:\r\nGET http://[::1]:22/?challenge=vLU7VauagR860z2P2sNTZkSNFJvdjt3zJ-qfZP1yIGU\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nServer: squid/3.1.19\r\nConnection: close\r\nX-Transformed-From: HTTP/0.9\r\nDate: Fri, 17 Apr 2015 02:23:10 GMT\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\n\r\nResponse Body (First 256 bytes):\r\nSSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1\\r\\nProtocol mismatch.\\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother URL that gives same result is ```http://testing6.allthethings.co.nz:22/``` where ```testing6.allthethings.co.nz``` is a domain that only has a AAAA record pointing to ::1 (localhost)\r\n\r\nI've tested using HTTP redirects (302's), but they fail, and domains that point to IPv4 localhost (```testing.allthethings.co.nz```) which also fail.\r\n\r\nWith this vulnerability, I am able to gain information about the local system, and potentially machines in neighbor networks to that machine. I can also send GET requests to a service running on any port on a system accessible to this machine. This could potentially cause damage to those internal applications. For examples of applications that may be vulnerable, please check out [this reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1TkWZtrhzRLy0bYXBcdLUedXGb9njTNIJXa3u9akHM/edit) which is now a bit outdated, but shows that there is a non zero amount of applications that may be vulnerable.\r\n\r\nNote that I could spend more time trying to figure out what applications there may be that are vulnerable on your internal network, but I feel this would go outside the intended scope of the bounty brief.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any more clarification or if you have questions. I'm happy to provide a screencast and/or screenshots of the vulnerability if needed.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHugh\r\n    ","bounty_amount":"512.0","formatted_bounty":"$512","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-05-23T23:45:29.672Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-201540354.87939602,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":8,"voters":["omarelfarsaoui","fantam1","khleymu_da","spetr0x","ph41ynx","bug1ess","aholtrop","w3sh"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":383256,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hi,\n\nThanks for reaching out to us.
