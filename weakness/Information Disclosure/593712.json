The purpose is simple: store files that are often retrieved, to reduce latency from the web server.\nWhen accessing a URL like http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css\nA GET request to that URL will be produced by the browser.  The server returns the content of http://www.example.com/home.php. And yes, the URL remains http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css. The HTTP headers will be the same as for accessing http://www.example.com/home.php directly: same caching headers and same content type (text/html, in this case).\nThe web cache servre saves the returned page in the server's cache. Then the attacker can go to the url: http://www.example.com/home.php/non-existent.css and the page of the victim will be presented with the victim's sensitive information (The page content).\n\nThe dangerous part in this attack, unlike phishing attacks, is that the url isn't looks suspicious at all.  It looks like a normal url from the original website, so the victim thinks that it is ok to click on the link.\n\nSteps:\n1. The attacker sends the following link to the victim: https://open.vanillaforums.com/messages/all/non-existent.css\n2. The victim opens the link and the inbox page will be loaded normally. (The web cache server then saves this page)\n3. The attacker open the same link (https://open.vanillaforums.com/messages/all/non-existent.css), and the inbox page of the victim with all his private contant is loaded.\n\nIf you need a video to understand it better, ask me and I will send you one.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe attacker can achieve all the private content of a specific victim, without the victim knowing about it.","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-12-01T09:07:41.440Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-58773884.2659163,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":44,"voters":["sameerphad72","spam404","mik317","ali","imranhudaa","ronr","aryan2808","sudi","tulswani","dmc3","and 34 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":4.3,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":2101,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.vanillaforums.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4982579,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":".","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-03T15:04:48.848Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T15:07:26.412Z","actor":{"username":"alex-vf","cleared":false,"url":"/alex-vf","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"vanilla","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4982656,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-06-03T15:10:38.082Z","updated_at":"2019-06-03T15:10:38.082Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"High","new_severity":"Medium (4.3)","old_severity_id":405990,"new_severity_id":408495},"actor":{"username":"alex-vf","cleared":false,"url":"/alex-vf","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"vanilla","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4982680,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Howdy, thanks for submitting this issue.
