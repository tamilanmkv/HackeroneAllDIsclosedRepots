In addition, any subdomain is considered trusted. If the origin is *http://www.grammarly.com*, then the server will respond: *Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.grammarly.com*. That can lead to leakage of user data and unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.\n{F517015}\n\nIn fact, this means that an attacker can use the MITM attack (Wi-Fi, local networks, etc.) to substitute client requests, thus replacing the origin. \n\n####*Important note: I very carefully read the program policy and focus on the fact that MITM attack is not made on the existent grammarly sites.*\n\n## How it works\n{F517002}\n\nIf an attacker can perform a mitm attack on a user, he can replace the requested content of any unencrypted request and produce a 302 redirect of the user to http: //evil.grammarly.com. Since the request is not unencrypted, the attacker can also replace the response and implement javascript that performs a requests to vulnerable endpoints. Thus, the vulnerable enpoint will think that the request came from the origin of the trust it trusts and will execute the request.\n\nUsing a header to send a CSRF token protects against such attacks. But I found a place where verification of the transferred token is not performed.\n\nThis vulnerability was perfectly described by James Kettle on OWASP AppSec EU 2017. You can watch the description of the vulnerability on the link to his presentation. https://youtu.be/wgkj4ZgxI4c?t=1139\n\n## Vulnerable enpoints\n\n1) The malicious javascript will look like:\n\n```javascript\nvar xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\nxhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {\n   if (this.readyState == 4 \u0026\u0026 this.status == 200) {\n       document.getElementById(\"response-node\").innerHTML = this.responseText;\n   }\n};\nxhttp.open(\"GET\", \"https://g-mail.grammarly.com/profile\", true);\nxhttp.withCredentials = true;\nxhttp.send();\n```\nThe response will contain the user's email address and subscription settings:\n```\n{\"id\":749327815,\"email\":\"email@yandex.ru\",\"preferenceFields\":[{\"name\":\"Weekly Progress Reports\",\"description\":\"Get a weekly report with statistics and insights on how you are writing with Grammarly.\",\"order\":49,\"value\":true},{\"name\":\"Product Updates\",\"description\":\"Important info on new features and products.

It's not a bug by itself. I completely agree. But this is the case if you use the CSRF token in the header.\n2. Not all, as we can see :)\n3. Yes. The header is set here but not checked on the server side.\n4. Yes.\n5. Ok.\n\nBut it seems that you have not fully understood the principle of attack. Sorry for some confusion in my report. Perhaps I did not fully explain the essence of the problem. Because it is somewhat larger than the usual СSRF. Using this method of attack, you can not only perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, but also receive user data through crossorigin ajax requests (bacause of CORS).\n\n1. Even if the CSRF token is not set in the header, it is impossible to perform a normal CSRF attack, since endpoint accepts only the application/json type requests. I report a way to attack through flash: https://hackerone.com/reports/437768, but it was closed as a duplicate. The report contained information about the attack on g-mail.grammarly.com/profile. I'm not sure, but I think that this attack method can work now. But I did not rely on this method of attack, as he was already known to the security team.\n\n2. Another type of attack with type application/json is javascript. So here I am talking exactly about it.\n\n## How it works\nWith the help of javascript, you can set the Content-Type: application/json header necessary for the attack. But how to execute json request to the server? Here comes the CORS. The CORS allows you to perform ajax requests from any (in your case) subdomain and allows the use of http protocol. In addition, the *Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true* header that is present in the server response allows the use of authorization cookies (profileToken in your case) to perform cross-origin requests.\n\nThus, the presence of headers:\n```\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: http://evil.grammarly.com (evil - reflected from Origin header)\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n```\nsays that the request from http://evil.grammarly.com will be trusted and will be able to use cookies to run on the server. \n\nBut there are several different types of incorrect settings of the cors, when the origin from which the request is executed is controlled by an attacker. For example:\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/426165\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/470298\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/235200\n\nBasically this is the wrong setting of the origin itself. You have this setting done correctly. But using the http protocol for cross-origin of requests creates the ability to conduct MITM attacks in order to spoof the origin.\n\n**So MITM attack is needed not to obtain an authorization cookie, but to replace the origin.** For more details, you can watch the video:  https://youtu.be/wgkj4ZgxI4c?t=1139\n\n## List of steps to steal data\n1. MITM attack and spoofing content and origin of http://evil.grammarly.com.\n2. Spoofed content of http://evil.grammarly.com contain javascript, which makes cross-orign GET request to  https://g-mail.grammarly.com/profile (for example).\n3. The attacker steals user data.\n\n## List of steps to perform actions on behalf of the user\n1. MITM attack and spoofing content and origin of http://evil.grammarly.com.\n2. Spoofed content of http://evil.grammarly.com contain javascript, which makes cross-orign POST request to  https://g-mail.grammarly.com/profile (for example).\n3.
