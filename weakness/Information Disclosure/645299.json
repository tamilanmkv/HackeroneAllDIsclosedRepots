The second condition seems to be queried in the unprotected schema. So this will return teams where the state equals soft_launched - but I'm not allowed to see the state.\n\nLooking at the resulting query also verifies this. for `_or:[{submission_state: {_eq: open}}, {submission_state: {_eq: closed}}]`:\n{F530641}\nAs you can see, for the first condition, `submission_state` has been converted to the secure `__new_filterable_submission_state` - but not for the second one. This probably also happens for `and` operator, but `or` was easier to verify. \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Open any graphql client (eg. https://electronjs.org/apps/graphiql) \n2. Run query\n\n```\nquery {\n  teams(where:{_or:[{state:{_eq:soft_launched}}, {state:{_eq:soft_launched}}]}) {\n    edges {\n      node {\n        id\n        state\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Note that it returns teams with `state: null`, because you're not allowed to see it - but now we know it's soft_launched.\n4. Optionally, also note that removing one of the conditions from the `or` list does not return these teams. This is because the first item is converted to query through the secure schema. \n████\n\n## Impact\n\nExpose/derive private information from any filterable field for collections that use the `where` graphql filters. Potentially extra risky as we introduce more filter fields.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSummary:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nsecure schema can be circumvented for graphql \u003ccode\u003ewhere\u003c/code\u003e filters by using \u003ccode\u003eor\u003c/code\u003e operator. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDescription:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen passing a where clause to a collection in the \u003ccode\u003egraphql\u003c/code\u003e endpoint, like \u003ccode\u003eteams(where:{ state: {_eq: soft_launched}})\u003c/code\u003e it queries the state through the secure schema - so it will not return any teams where the state does equal soft_launched but you\u0026#39;re not allowed to see the state. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, when using an \u003ccode\u003eor\u003c/code\u003e operator. like \u003ccode\u003eteams(where:{_or: [{state: {_eq: soft_launched}, {state: {_eq: soft_launched}]}\u003c/code\u003e - only the first condition in the list seems to be converted to the secure variant.

This won't be eligible for a bounty because you're a team member of HackerOne.\n\nThe root cause of this vulnerability was definitely interesting: SQL queries that are executed in a GraphQL context use our so-called secure schema. This is a set of materialized views that contain a subset of the database. This is an additional measure we've taken against information disclosure vulnerabilities. When a normal query was executed, e.g. `query { teams(where: { state: { _eq: soft_launched } }) }`, the following code would be hit (simplified):\n\n```ruby\nset = Set.new\nset.add state: 'soft_launched'\n\n# =\u003e #\u003cSet {{:state=\u003e\"soft_launched\"}}\u003e\n```\n\nWhen an `_or` query would be specified (e.g. `teams(where: { _or : [ { state: { _eq: soft_launched } }, { state: { _eq: soft_launched } } ] } )`, the following code would execute:\n\n```ruby\nset = Set.new\nset.add state: 'soft_launched'\nset.add state: 'soft_launched'\n\n# =\u003e #\u003cSet {{:state=\u003e\"soft_launched\"}}\u003e\n```\n\nIn Ruby 2.3, due to the lack of comparing by identity, the `set` variable would only contain `{ \"state\" =\u003e \"soft_launched\" }` once. This caused the input to diverge from what was being used in the SQL query. This resulted in only the first occurrence of `state` to be queried against the secure schema. The second `state` query would be queried against the raw schema, which contains all `team` objects.\n\nThe solution to this problem was to use the `compare_by_identity` method that was introduced in Ruby 2.4, which changes the behavior and doesn't remove when any subsequent `where` clause is the same as the first one:\n\n```ruby\nset = Set.new.compare_by_identity\nset.add state: 'soft_launched'\nset.add state: 'soft_launched'\n\n# =\u003e #\u003cSet {{:state=\u003e\"soft_launched\"}, {:state=\u003e\"soft_launched\"}}\u003e\n```\n\nIn this particular case, this resulted in the ability to identify private programs when they have a published external program.","markdown_message":"\u003cp\u003eThanks again, \u003ca href=\"/reigertje\"\u003e@reigertje\u003c/a\u003e, great find and thanks for taking care of fixing it, too!
