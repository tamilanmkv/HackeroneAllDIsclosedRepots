However, the Kaspersky Chrome extension will automatically fill-in stored credentials for the iframe's URL-based origin, even though the sandboxed iframe has an effective origin of `null`. This behavior appears to disregard the effective origin of sandboxed iframes and the expected cross-origin restrictions that would apply because of the effective origin.\n\nFor attacks, no user interaction is required (drive-by). The user only needs to load a page, and Kaspersky will immediately autofill stored credentials on page load. No prior interaction with the sandboxed iframe is required.\n\n# Environment\n- Scope: Application\n- Product name: Kaspersky Password Manager (Chrome extension)\n- Product version: 4.1.15\n- OS name and version (incl SP): Windows 10 OS Version 1809 (Build 17763.557)\n- Chrome version: 75.0.3770.100 (Official Build) (64-bit) (cohort: Stable)\n- Attack type: Sensitive user data disclosure\n- Maximum user privileges needed to reproduce your issue: no local privileges needed, remote\n\n# Steps to reproduce\nDemo login form (set up): https://alesandroortiz.com/~aor/security/creds-tests/test-form.html\nPage containing iframe (vuln demo): https://alesandroortiz.com/~aor/security/creds-tests/test-case-sandbox.html\nPage in iframe (attacker page): https://alesandroortiz.com/~aor/security/creds-tests/test-ucc-iframe.html\n\n## Set up (to store credentials in site-controlled origin):\n1. Navigate to https://alesandroortiz.com/~aor/security/creds-tests/test-form.html\n2. Enter any values into the email and password input fields, then submit form. (Simulates a login on a site-controlled form.)\n3. On the next page, click \"Save\" when Kaspersky prompts to save credentials for the origin.\n\n## Steps to reproduce:\n1. Navigate to https://alesandroortiz.com/~aor/security/creds-tests/test-case-sandbox.html\n\n### Expected behavior:\nKaspersky does not immediately autofill credentials in the sandboxed iframe because there are no credentials stored for the unique origin (`null`). The effective origin is `null`.\n\n### Observed behavior:\nKaspersky immediately autofills credentials in the fully sandboxed iframe, which is on its own unique origin (`null`), because there are stored credentials for the URL-based origin (`https://alesandroortiz.com`).\n\n# Other info\n\nThe important sandbox attribute value relevant to this report is `allow-same-origin`. If this value is NOT set, the iframe will be in its own unique origin (`null`), meaning it should be untrusted. If the value is set, the iframe will be in its normal origin (based on iframe URL's origin), meaning it can interact normally with its own origin.\n\nSandbox bypass works on both same origin (e.g. `https://example.com`) and different origin within same domain (e.g. `https://subdomain.example.com`), even though sandbox attribute without `allow-same-origin` value by spec should be treated as a completely unique origin (e.g. `null`). Correctly following spec, Chrome sets window.origin to `null` for fully sandboxed iframes. Same-origin policy goes both ways: When a particular resource (e.g. iframe) is restricted by policy from interacting with other resources (e.g. parent window), those other resources (e.g. parent window) are also restricted from interacting with the restricted resource (e.g. iframe).\n\nSee HTML spec: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/iframe-embed-object.html#attr-iframe-sandbox\n\n\u003e The sandbox attribute, when specified, enables a set of extra restrictions on any content hosted by the iframe. [...] When the attribute is set, the content is treated as being from a unique origin, forms, scripts, and various potentially annoying APIs are disabled, links are prevented from targeting other browsing contexts, and plugins are secured. The `allow-same-origin` keyword causes the content to be treated as being from its real origin instead of forcing it into a unique origin;\n\nFor different phrasing, also see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#Attributes under the sandbox attribute's possible values:\n\n\u003e allow-same-origin: If this token is not used, the resource is treated as being from a special origin that always fails the same-origin policy.\n\n# Demo source \n\nAttached HTML files are source of hosted files. To demo on your own site, change the URLs in all files to reference your demo site. Screen recording demonstrating reproduction method is also attached.\n\n## Impact\n\nA sandboxed iframe loaded on target site can exfiltrate credentials with no user interaction (drive-by). Sites do not expect sandboxed iframes to be able to obtain user credentials used on their site, due to expected cross-origin restrictions.\n\nSome sites with user-controlled content use sandboxed iframes loaded from their own domain or subdomain to render user-controlled content. The vulnerability allows an attacker to exfiltrate stored credentials in when a user visits the page on the target site containing the specially crafted user-controlled content.","weakness":{"id":18,"name":"Information Disclosure"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-10-10T17:29:00.362Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-63236755.12393384,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":23,"voters":["foobar7","mashoud1122","sameerphad72","alesandroortiz","lp1dev","jlleitschuh","cyberunit","codeanddecode","cryptographer","b635e0cba4cabf8cbdaf222","and 13 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5373325,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi man!\n\nThank you for reaching out to us.

The observed behavior is below:\n\nWith the default \"Everywhere on example.com\" setting, KPM applies a different-domain security rule which **does not** fill-in credentials for an iframe on a different domain (e.g. `different-domain.com`). This is because the different-domain iframe is on `different-domain.com`, and KPM treats the iframe as being on `different-domain.com` and not `example.com`.\nThis behavior is different compared to what the comment described, but it is what I expect to be secure behavior, so this behavior is okay.\nDifferent domain test case: https://alesandroortiz.com/~aor/security/creds-tests/test-case-diff-domain.html\n\nThe problem is the following behavior: Also with the default \"Everywhere on example.com\" setting, KPM **ignores** the different-domain rule for sandboxed iframes. KPM treats the sandboxed iframe as being on the origin of `example.com`, when KPM should treat the iframe as being on the origin of `null`. KPM's behavior in this scenario is unexpected by website operators and users, because it deviates from the HTML specification, and poses security risks (described in original report).\n\nPer the HTML specification, sandboxed iframes must be on their own unique origin (`null`) and should **always** be treated as being on a different domain, no exceptions. Since the origin `null` is not on the domain `example.com`, I expect KPM to treat the sandboxed iframe the same way it treats an iframe on `different-domain.com`. All major browsers and their built-in password managers follow the HTML specification and treat the sandboxed iframe as being on a different origin, and does not fill-in credentials.\n\nRegarding this comment:\n\u003e You can change this behavior with \"Select authentication scope\" option that is applied to every credentials item in \"Passwords for websites\" section of the application (its main window). If you choose \"Only this domain\", your attack won't be working anymore.\n\nWhile this is a potential mitigating factor, it is not the default setting, and the option descriptions are not clear enough to make users realize the security risk of the default option.\n\nIf a user finds the setting and decides to change the setting, based on the option text, the expected KPM behavior is:\n* \"Everywhere on example.com\" includes `example.com` and `subdomain.example.com`. Excludes `different-domain.com` and `null`-origin sandboxed iframes.\n* \"Only on example.com\" only includes `example.com`. Excludes `subdomain.example.com`, `different-domain.com`, and `null`-origin sandboxed iframes.\n\nHowever, the observed KPM behavior is:\n* \"Everywhere on example.com\" includes `example.com`, `subdomain.example.com` AND `null`-origin sandboxed iframes. Excludes `different-domain.com`.\n* \"Only on example.com\" (same as expected behavior).\n\nThe observed behavior is different than the expected behavior, since it is not clear to the user that `null`-origin sandboxed iframes are allowed under \"Everywhere on example.com\", since `null`-origin sandboxed iframes are **not** on `example.com`, per the HTML specification.\n\nTo summarize: The default behavior deviates from the HTML specification, posing security risks. The setting's options are not clear enough for user to realize the risk, and require complex user actions to activate the mitigation. I believe the core issue is the deviation from HTML specification -- no mitigation will resolve that inconsistency.\n\nLet me know if you need further information or have questions.\n\nRegards,\nAlesandro","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-07-25T23:50:48.577Z","updated_at":"2019-07-25T23:50:48.577Z","actor":{"username":"alesandroortiz","cleared":true,"url":"/alesandroortiz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/281/801/9c6833231ccd8fb957dfd04cc325d7ea2cf4b81b_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"kaspersky","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5433042,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"To add to my last comment: As far as I know, there isn't a valid use-case where a sandboxed iframe is trusted by the website operator, since the intended use of the sandbox attribute is as an explicit indicator that the website operator does not fully trust the contents of the iframe.

However, the sandboxed iframe scenario should be treated the same way as the cross-domain scenario you suggested, for the reasons I explained in earlier comments. Because it isn't treated the same, I consider the behavior a vulnerability.\n\nDoes your team think KPM should continue using the URL-based origin instead of the effective origin?\nIf so, can you explain how this behavior is safer than the behavior followed by browsers' built-in password managers, which follow the HTML specification?\n\nWebsites depend on layers of security, often provided by the HTML specification and additional security features implemented by web browsers. KPM users have a layer of security removed due to the deviation from the HTML specification. If any software (i.e. extensions) removes a layer of security that is implemented by the original software or specification (i.e. web browser + HTML spec), I consider it a security issue.\n\nThe clearest comparison is all major browsers' built-in password managers, which accurately implement this security feature from the HTML specification and do not deviate from it. I would use the built-in password managers as a benchmark when there is doubt about whether a behavior is according to specification. In this case, KPM behaves differently compared to built-in password managers.\n\nI know each vendor's decision making is independent, but for context, other vendors have determined this exact issue is a high- or critical-level security issue and implemented fixes. Many other vendors already followed the HTML specification and didn't have a reportable security issue to start with.\n\nRegards,\nAlesandro","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-07-26T22:46:01.603Z","updated_at":"2019-07-26T22:50:00.096Z","actor":{"username":"alesandroortiz","cleared":true,"url":"/alesandroortiz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/281/801/9c6833231ccd8fb957dfd04cc325d7ea2cf4b81b_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"kaspersky","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5443322,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-07-27T08:18:39.000Z","updated_at":"2019-07-27T08:18:39.000Z","actor":{"username":"artem_baranov","cleared":false,"url":"/artem_baranov","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/257/241/2e90c2393e57c257791b2e8deb7c0a43607a1315_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"kaspersky","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":5529154,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi Artem,\n\nThanks for triaging.
