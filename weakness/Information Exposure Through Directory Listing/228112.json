Exploiting Zend Framework only works in the following circumstances:\n\n* Your routes are configured as a wildcard. (It defaults to the domain name used during setup, so you'd have to do this intentionally.)\n* You don't have a `From:` value set in the configuration. (Upon closer inspection, this is not set by default.)\n\nThat's why you can't get it to work on cspr.ng. We're not misconfigured to allow control over the `From:` header.\n\nThe full path disclosure: Only exists when debug is set to TRUE in universal.json.\n\nAlthough this is a duplicate, I'm going to mark it as resolved so you get some kudos points for your effort. I'm also probably going to push out a patch that side-steps it on our end, since that Zend\\Mail pull request is sitting unmerged.\n\nAlso, this isn't an SQL error.
