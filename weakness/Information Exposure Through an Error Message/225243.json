As with all things in life, as we learn more about our attack surface and adjust our understanding of security impact, bounties will change -- this type of iteration is called out right on our current scope page: *\"We will adapt as the program continues.\"*\n\nIn fact, we have a treasuremap2.0 release that will be done in approximately a month -- this plans to explicitly address how our program has matured since it's inception.\n\n\u003e Your policy also states that phone number exposure is significant issue.\n\n\u003e\u003e Significant Issues ($5,000) - Stored Cross-site Scripting which can cause significant brand damage (e.g. in a homepage), missing authorization checks leading to the exposure of email addresses, date of birth, names, phone numbers, etc.\n\nYes, it is in that category. It also states right above that: *\"amounts listed here are the maximum\"*. Those numbers are meant as maximums (as we have discussed in previous tickets) -- they are not the amount guaranteed for any given \"significant\" issue.\n\n\u003e Weird part is that you paid 2k for email-\u003ephone number lookup ( #195224 ) in which we need to brute force 6 digit of phone number whereas this report do not require any brute force and we can get victim's phone by email/uuid only get 1.5k.\n\nActually, #195224 is turning phone number into email, not the other way around -- this is inconsequential to the main discussion, but is a perfect example of the idea that mistakes happen and we should always assume best intent.\n\nThere is nothing weird about this -- we missed your after-triage-comment (with no supporting evidence) when we were having our bounty determination meeting. Now that you have brought that to our attention, I imagine this will be awarded the same amount as #195224 since it has similar properties.\n\nThe reason this original got awarded less than #195224 is because our assumption that a UUID was required, which is obviously harder to guess than brute forcing 6 digits of a phone number.\n\n\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-06-01T22:08:25.457Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T22:08:25.457Z","actor":{"username":"fletcher","cleared":false,"url":"/fletcher","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/090/8b777383ddc3ab23063609c8beb1cb1f689a75c1_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1723402,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"Our initial assumption was that this required a UUID, but the researcher brought to our attention that you could use just an email (similar to a previous one of their reports).\n\nWe're upping the bounty to $2000 total to be inline with other reports that had similar attack scenarios and impact.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-06-01T22:15:04.579Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T22:15:04.579Z","actor":{"url":"/uber","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/314/24ea21370a71b18eafb5722d5855825ab622b5dd_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Uber"}},"bounty_amount":"500.0","bounty_currency":"usd","bonus_amount":"0.0","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","collaborator":{"username":"vijay_kumar","url":"/vijay_kumar"},"actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1723405,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-06-01T22:15:23.997Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T22:15:23.997Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"High","new_severity":"Medium","old_severity_id":39765,"new_severity_id":47481},"actor":{"username":"fletcher","cleared":false,"url":"/fletcher","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/090/8b777383ddc3ab23063609c8beb1cb1f689a75c1_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1723410,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportTitleUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-06-01T22:16:32.853Z","updated_at":"2017-06-01T22:16:32.853Z","additional_data":{"old_title":"Get user's (Rider+Driver) Phone Number using UUID","new_title":"phone number exposure for riders/drivers given email/uuid"},"actor":{"username":"fletcher","cleared":false,"url":"/fletcher","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/090/8b777383ddc3ab23063609c8beb1cb1f689a75c1_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1724485,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@fletcher \n\n\u003eFurthermore, you made a follow-up comment (on an already triaged report) stating that it was possible to use with email, but you provided no evidence or PoC to support that claim. \n\n1.

If in any case payouts are changed then it should be updated on program policy page but you have not made any changes in policy in last 7 month regarding payout of private information exposure vulnerability.\n\nBased on previously disclosed report (eg. #127158 , #127087 , #127161 ) most researcher will assume that universal user UUIDs are not mitigating factor because these report get full payout but now you says that UUID is a mitigating factor and now payout for UUID-\u003eemail/phone lookup vulnerability will be $1500 , so it will be good idea to disclose this report so other researcher know what should they expect for these type of issue.\n\n\u003eAfter addressing the other details in your comment and determining if we need to award more of a bounty, I'm happy to do full disclosure.\n\nI hope this report will be public soon as you mentioned .
