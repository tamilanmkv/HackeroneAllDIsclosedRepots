The dashboard that shows these administrators details of a registration request calls the endpoint `https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/pendingUserDetails/(REGISTRATION_ID)`, where `(REGISTRATION_ID)` is numeric.\n\nThis endpoint will, without authentication, return the email, address, phone, attachment IDs, address, corporate info, and user roles. It will also return their request status and denial reason if applicable.\n\nAttachments can then be viewed unauthenticated through `https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/getAttachmentBytes/(ATTACHMENT_ID)`.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Navigate to the following URL: https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/pendingUserDetails/2634\n  2. For attachments, navigate to the following URL: https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/getAttachmentBytes/600\n\n## Recommended Mitigation:\nOnly allow users with valid JWT tokens for the admin role view these two endpoints.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn unauthorized attacker can view personal information about contractors and employees gaining access to TAMS.","weakness":{"id":55,"name":"Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2021-05-07T04:45:08.544Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-13595722.868073432,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":42,"voters":["neptunium","battle_angel","skarsom","ali","ibring","0nlymohammed","h4x0r_dz","akashhamal0x01","dnelsaka","sa1tama0","and 32 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","score":7.5,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":59974,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"tams.gsa.gov","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10141942,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Hello @skarsom and thanks for your report,\n\nI am not able to see different PII/Documents - I can see only yours - by iterating over the ids on https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/pendingUserDetails/2631 and https://tamsapi.gsa.gov/user/tams/api/usermgmnt/getAttachmentBytes/400 for instance.\n\nWere you able to find other valid ids with sensitive information?\n\nBest regards,\n@turtle_shell","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-12-18T10:06:37.109Z","updated_at":"2020-12-18T10:06:37.109Z","actor":{"username":"turtle_shell","cleared":false,"url":"/turtle_shell","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/UEHxCfDVKTBNymNpNGb7qwy6/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":true,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gsa_vdp","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":true},{"id":10141977,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Hi @turtle_shell,\n\nFirst, I just want to say I still remember your amazing work on some of the other reports I made months ago.
