Forward the request, your co-team member profile settings will be edited.\n\n__NOTE:__ I ask permission to my friend which is member if parrot sec, I used this test profile https://hackerone.com/parrotsec1 to perform IDOR against this other team member profile: https://hackerone.com/phspade , both are team members of parrot sec. I successfully remove the public __Teams__ visibility of other team member @phspade without user interaction.\n\nLet me know if anything else is
