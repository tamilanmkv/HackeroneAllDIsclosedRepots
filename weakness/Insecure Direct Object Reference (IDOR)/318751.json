I apologise i couldn't mention the Impact and severity of the issue. Actually In exchange Admin can add multiple photos but only one Photo can be displayed on exchange listing. Example : Admin of listing can add 10 photos but he can only display one photo on exchange listing. So all other Photos should be private to admin only but with this issue Attacker has ability to disclose all the private photos . Also when the Listing is Unpublished then Listing is not available to Public but still the attacker can have access to the Photos of any Unpublished listing . Also The Attack Complexity is very low which leads to easily access to all the photos of Shopify without any much efforts. \nA very important point you missed here is it's also Disclosing a Domain names of All shopify Stores. \nEx: https://exchange.shopifycdn.com/screenshots/vijaykumar007hackeronestore.myshopify.com-e782cc44893e386a.jpg\nHere \" vijaykumar007hackeronestore.myshopify.com\" is my Domain name . I am getting Domain names for all the Shopify Stores with this. \nAdditionally the issue is in Shopify Core and Direct . So according to me the reward amount should be higher then this. I request you to Re look into the above mentioned Points and Help me out here if possible.

All the screenshots for a given shop will be displayed once the listing is approved and published, you will be able to see the rest of the them at the bottom of the page.\n\nAlthough I didn't mention it on my response, the bounty decision was taken keeping in mind the shop domains were also accessible. We don't think retrieving the domain name in the response increases the severity of this issue as they are as well meant to be public once the listings are approved.\n\nExchange is an embedded app. Embedded apps or some of their sections can be rendered within Shopify Core, so even though screenshots were being shown in the Shopify admin area the logic behind what screenshots should be shown resides in the code of Exchange.\n\nThe bounty amount won't be increased unless a wider impact or alternative ways to exploit this issue are proven.
