One of the Bugs overview filters enables a program member to filter by Hackathon that their program was a part of. This filter is applied when hackathon IDs are provided in the `hackathons` parameter, like https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=security\u0026hackathons[]=28.\n\nThe parameter takes an array of IDs and is vulnerable to an IDOR. When a hackathon ID is given that belongs to a private hackathon, a date range will be applied. Based on the extremes of the returned reports submission date, a user could determine the date range of the hackathon.\n\nThis vulnerability is easier to exploit for a program that has a lot of reports submitted on different days.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe date range of a private hackathon could be determined. At the moment, there aren't any real hackathon objects that are marked as private, so no sensitive information is disclosed.","weakness":{"id":55,"name":"Insecure Direct Object Reference
