You chose a rather disruptive demonstration on gitlab.com that's unfortunate but luckily there was no real damage. For any future reports you should stick to the rules of our Bug Bounty program.\n\nEspecially since you indicated in your report:\n\n\u003e Because the rate limit is out of scope, I tested it ..\n\nWe want to stress the fact that “out of scope” does  **not** mean we don’t consider this a vulnerability unless demonstrated. It means **we don’t want or need this to be tested against at all by independent researchers**. We have several internal, ongoing initiatives to reduce the impact of rate limits, such as https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1737. We also contract regular assessments which include items we have defined as out-of-scope for the public bounty program.\n\nThe purpose of bug bounty policies are to set expectations for both parties, the organizations and bounty hunters, as well as build trust between them. We believe that intentionally not adhering to program bug bounty policies, such as this, negatively impacts the industry as a whole as it doesn't encourage more companies to run bug bounty programs, and it diminishes trust with the bounty hunter community.\n\nWe will be closing this report as Not Applicable. You may create a new account on GitLab.com using your `@wearehackerone.com` alias, but any further violation of the rules of engagement will result in a ban from our bounty program and GitLab.com.\n\nThe rules of engagement can be found here: https://hackerone.com/gitlab?type=team\nFor convenience I've also pasted it below, with the relevant sections highlighted:\n\u003e# Rules of Engagement, Testing, and Proof-of-concepts\n\n\u003eWhen researching security issues, especially those which may compromise the privacy of others, you must use only test accounts in order to respect our users’ privacy. Accessing private information of other users, **performing actions that may negatively affect GitLab’s users (e.g., spam, denial of service) will disqualify the report**. Activity that is disruptive to GitLab operations will result in account bans and disqualification of the report. Examples of disruptive activity include, but are not limited to:\n - Generating abuse requests\n - Submission of support, sales or other requests to 3rd party systems\n - Mass creation of users, groups, and projects\n - Typosquatting or other namesquatting\n - **Spam-like or other high volume activity**\n\n\u003eSending reports from automated tools without verifying them will immediately disqualify the report.\n\n\u003e**Disruptive activity such as that listed above can be researched freely on your own installation of `gitlab`.** GitLab is an open-core company, with the source code powering gitlab.com available at https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss and https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab. You are encouraged to [install](https://about.gitlab.com/installation/) your own standalone instance for researching vulnerabilities. Screen captures, logs, and videos showing vulnerabilities against your own GitLab installation are encouraged.\n\n\u003e## Testing on GitLab.com\nWhen testing on GitLab.com, your `@wearehackerone.com` address must be associated with the testing account. If separate accounts are necessary, [you can use an alias](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/hacker-email-alias.html#multiple-aliases). This will help us separate testing from other forms of abuse, and help inform the decision of blocking an account. Note that this does not provide immunity and the Rules of engagement must be followed at all times.\n\nKind regards,\nJames\nGitLab Security Team\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-09-14T23:02:12.524Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T23:02:12.524Z","actor":{"username":"jritchey","cleared":false,"url":"/jritchey","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9221300,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-09-14T23:16:08.804Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T23:16:08.804Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"jritchey","cleared":false,"url":"/jritchey","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9221306,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"It would be better to do the tests in my own environment, sorry for the problem, it will not be repeated.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-09-14T23:19:40.084Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T23:19:40.084Z","actor":{"username":"sadd_man","cleared":false,"url":"/sadd_man","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9221329,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"It's important to do it in the test environment, I hope my apology is accepted.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-09-14T23:28:30.921Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T23:28:30.921Z","actor":{"username":"sadd_man","cleared":false,"url":"/sadd_man","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9221330,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-09-14T23:28:30.972Z","updated_at":"2020-09-14T23:28:30.972Z","actor":{"username":"sadd_man","cleared":false,"url":"/sadd_man","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
