This results in the x-uber-token still being active even after a user has logged out, giving an attacker the ability to access and/or modify all aspects of an Uber Rider's (and potentially Driver's) customer information.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n1. Login using the Microsoft Store Uber App with an interception proxy to capture the session data. Make a note of the issued x-uber-token.\n2. Logout of the Microsoft Store Uber App.\n3.

The consequences will vary, depending on what the mechanisms are trying to protect.\n\nCWE-539: Information Exposure Through Persistent Cookies\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/539.html\n\nCookies are small bits of data that are sent by the web application but stored locally in the browser. This lets the application use the cookie to pass information between pages and store variable information. The web application controls what information is stored in a cookie and how it is used. Typical types of information stored in cookies are session Identifiers, personalization and customization information, and in rare cases even usernames to enable automated logins. There are two different types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies just live in the browser's memory, and are not stored anywhere, but persistent cookies are stored on the browser's hard drive.\n\nCWE-384: Session Fixation\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/384.html\n\nSuch a scenario is commonly observed when:\n1. A web application authenticates a user without first invalidating the existing session, thereby continuing to use the session already associated with the user.\n2. An attacker is able to force a known session identifier on a user so that, once the user authenticates, the attacker has access to the authenticated session.\n3. The application or container uses predictable session identifiers. In the generic exploit of session fixation vulnerabilities, an attacker creates a new session on a web application and records the associated session identifier. The attacker then causes the victim to associate, and possibly authenticate, against the server using that session identifier, giving the attacker access to the user's account through the active session.\n\nCWE-613: Insufficient Session Expiration\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/613.html\n\nAccording to WASC, \"Insufficient Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old session credentials or session IDs for authorization.\"\n\nThe lack of proper session expiration may improve the likely success of certain attacks. For example, an attacker may intercept a session ID, possibly via a network sniffer or Cross-site Scripting attack. Although short session expiration times do not help if a stolen token is immediately used, they will protect against ongoing replaying of the session ID. In another scenario, a user might access a web site from a shared computer (such as at a library, Internet cafe, or open work environment). Insufficient Session Expiration could allow an attacker to use the browser's back button to access web pages previously accessed by the victim.\n\nCWE-262: Not Using Password Aging\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/262.html\n\nIf no mechanism is in place for managing password aging, users will have no incentive to update passwords in a timely manner.\n\nThe recommendation that users change their passwords regularly and do not reuse passwords is universal among security experts. In order to enforce this, it is useful to have a password aging mechanism that notifies users when passwords are considered old and that requests that they replace them with new, strong passwords. In order for this functionality to be useful, however, it must be accompanied with documentation which stresses how important this practice is and which makes the entire process as simple as possible for the user.\n\nCWE-263: Password Aging with Long Expiration\n\nhttps://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/263.html\n\nJust as neglecting to include functionality for the management of password aging is dangerous, so is allowing password aging to continue unchecked. Passwords must be given a maximum life span, after which a user is required to update with a new and different password.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-11-29T22:06:06.999Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T22:06:06.999Z","actor":{"username":"gregoryvperry","cleared":false,"url":"/gregoryvperry","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2189945,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-11-29T22:07:24.031Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T22:07:24.031Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"gregoryvperry","cleared":false,"url":"/gregoryvperry","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2190051,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"On a side note, I do not believe that this particular implementation error within the Uber legacy authentication system can be resolved with an upgrade to the Uber family of apps, without invalidating the apps installed on tens of millions of iOS, Android and Windows Phone devices.\n\nThis is a fundamental flaw within the core of Uber's entire authentication process logic unfortunately.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-11-29T22:56:01.795Z","updated_at":"2017-11-29T22:56:01.795Z","actor":{"username":"gregoryvperry","cleared":false,"url":"/gregoryvperry","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2195051,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Closing it `Informative` is not a judgement on the validity of the report -- it simply indicates we already knew about this and are actively addressing it already.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-12-01T23:48:15.936Z","updated_at":"2017-12-01T23:48:15.936Z","actor":{"username":"fletcher","cleared":false,"url":"/fletcher","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/090/8b777383ddc3ab23063609c8beb1cb1f689a75c1_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2245219,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-12-24T20:16:44.800Z","updated_at":"2017-12-24T20:16:44.800Z","actor":{"username":"fletcher","cleared":false,"url":"/fletcher","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/090/8b777383ddc3ab23063609c8beb1cb1f689a75c1_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2245220,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-12-24T20:16:44.861Z","updated_at":"2017-12-24T20:16:44.861Z","actor":{"username":"fletcher","cleared":false,"url":"/fletcher","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/016/090/8b777383ddc3ab23063609c8beb1cb1f689a75c1_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
