Login to hackerone.com\n  2. Go to sensitive page and capture the `GraphQL` request , on my case i captured the bounty settings `{\"query\":\"query User_bounty_settings_page... etc` on this end point: https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties\n  3. Send the GraphQL request to repeater\n  4. Go to https://hackerone.com/settings/sessions and click `Revoke` to destroy the current session\n  5. You will be logout to your account, means session destroyed\n  6. Go back to burp repeater and click `Go` to repeat the graphql request\n  7. Observed that you can still query the graphql `User_bounty_settings_page`, and it will disclosed the reports that was rewarded, including the amounts, report title, payment method used and other sensitive information.\n\n__Below is my sample GraphQL query and response after revoking the session:__\n\n```\n{\"query\":\"query User_bounty_settings_page($first_0:Int!,$currency_1:CurrencyCode!,$currency_2:CurrencyCode!) {\\n  me {\\n    id,\\n    ...Fg\\n  }\\n}\\nfragment F0 on PayoutPreferenceInterface {\\n  default,\\n  id,\\n  __typename\\n}\\nfragment F1 on Node {\\n  id,\\n  __typename\\n}\\nfragment F2 on User {\\n  tax_form {\\n    url,\\n    hello_sign_client_id,\\n    status,\\n    id\\n  },\\n  email,\\n  bounties {\\n    total_count\\n  },\\n  payout_preferences {\\n    __typename,\\n    ...F0,\\n    ...F1\\n  },\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment F3 on CoinbasePayoutPreferenceType {\\n  email,\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment F4 on PaypalPayoutPreferenceType {\\n  email,\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment F5 on HackeronePayrollPayoutPreferenceType {\\n  email,\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment F6 on CurrencycloudBankTransferPayoutPreferenceType {\\n  name,\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment F7 on User {\\n  payout_preferences {\\n    __typename,\\n    ...F0,\\n    ...F3,\\n    ...F4,\\n    ...F5,\\n    ...F6,\\n    ...F1\\n  },\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment F8 on User {\\n  _bounties4glIUB:bounties(first:$first_0) {\\n    edges {\\n      node {\\n        id,\\n        _id,\\n        awarded_amount,\\n        bonus_amount,\\n        awarded_currency,\\n        created_at,\\n        status,\\n        report {\\n          _id,\\n          title,\\n          team {\\n            name,\\n            handle,\\n            id\\n          },\\n          id\\n        }\\n      },\\n      cursor\\n    },\\n    pageInfo {\\n      hasNextPage,\\n      hasPreviousPage\\n    }\\n  },\\n  _bounties1CaoNY:bounties(currency:$currency_1) {\\n    total_amount\\n  },\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment F9 on User {\\n  _report_retest_usersixO8i:report_retest_users(completed:true,last:$first_0) {\\n    completed_count,\\n    edges {\\n      node {\\n        id,\\n        completed_at,\\n        report_retest {\\n          report {\\n            _id,\\n            team {\\n              handle,\\n              name,\\n              id\\n            },\\n            id\\n          },\\n          id\\n        }\\n      },\\n      cursor\\n    },\\n    pageInfo {\\n      hasNextPage,\\n      hasPreviousPage\\n    }\\n  },\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment Fa on User {\\n  tax_form {\\n    url,\\n    status,\\n    signed_at,\\n    type,\\n    id\\n  },\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment Fb on User {\\n  id\\n}\\nfragment Fc on User {\\n  _bounties3jJC5o:bounties(currency:$currency_2) {\\n    total_amount\\n  },\\n  lufthansa_account {\\n    id\\n  },\\n  id,\\n  ...Fb\\n}\\nfragment Fd on User {\\n  tax_form {\\n    id\\n  },\\n  id,\\n  ...Fb\\n}\\nfragment Fe on User {\\n  lufthansa_account {\\n    first_name,\\n    last_name,\\n    number,\\n    id\\n  },\\n  id,\\n  ...Fb\\n}\\nfragment Ff on User {\\n  id,\\n  ...Fb\\n}\\nfragment Fg on User {\\n  id,\\n  tax_form {\\n    url,\\n    id\\n  },\\n  ...F2,\\n  ...F7,\\n  ...F8,\\n  ...F9,\\n  ...Fa,\\n  ...Fc,\\n  ...Fd,\\n  ...Fe,\\n  ...Ff\\n}\",\"variables\":{\"first_0\":100,\"currency_1\":\"USD\",\"currency_2\":\"XLA\n```\n\n__Response:__\n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Tue, 02 Oct 2018 02:01:20 GMT\nContent-Type: application/json;

This seems to something we missed on our side.\n\nI wanted to give you some background: the root cause of this problem comes from the fact that the GraphQL tokens are tied to a `User` object, not the individual sessions. This essentially means that all sessions use the same underlying secret token to generate a valid authentication token for GraphQL. We revoke this token when you'd sign out. The reason why this was never a problem was because we'd sign out ALL sessions. If we were to regenerate the token on revocation, all the other sessions would have to refresh their page, which is not a great UX. The solution to this would be to move the GraphQL secret token to the sessions OR deprecate the current authentication strategy (token) and implement OAuth (this would be better, although requires more time).\n\nI also wanted to point out two other things:\n\n1. The GraphQL token can only be refreshed with a valid sessions; because this is revoked, an attacker wouldn't be able to obtain a new GraphQL token when they have a user's GraphQL token\n2. A GraphQL token is only valid for 15 minutes; this means that the attacker needs to extract all the information or call the mutations within 15 minutes after the session was revoked\n\nWe're going ahead and triage this. Given the above, this one might be open for some time. It is not a very likely exploit scenario, but we want the revocation to be an actual revocation of the entire session, not a partial one. We were also not aware of this, so we want to thank you for that by triaging this and awarding you with a bounty.\n\nThanks, good luck, and happy hacking!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-03T18:53:35.472Z","updated_at":"2018-10-03T18:53:35.472Z","actor":{"username":"jobert","cleared":true,"url":"/jobert","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/ht4b9SmcYNqmpbyCFXd7cxHB/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3431926,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @jobert \n\nThanks for giving me a very detailed background regarding the GraphQL token, much appreciated :)\n\n\u003eThe solution to this would be to move the GraphQL secret token to the sessions OR deprecate the current authentication strategy (token) and implement OAuth (this would be better, although requires more time).\n\nI agree, moving the GraphQL secret token to sessions was good.. but no worries if it requires more time for the other option.. it's all up to you if what solution would you like to implement.\n\n\u003eI also wanted to point out two other things.\n\nI agree with the 2 items pointed out above, but i just want to remind you that 15 mins (graphql session expiration) is enough time for the attacker to extract sensitive information as well as calling `POST` request GraphQL mutations for a critical endpoint such as updating payment method etc.\n\n\u003eWe're going ahead and triage this.
