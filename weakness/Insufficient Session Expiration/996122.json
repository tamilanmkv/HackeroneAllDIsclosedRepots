Many of the meeting rooms have chat history and files uploaded. Some of the chat history and files contains personal identifiable information.\n\nWalkthrough Section:\n\n1. To confirmed this vulnerability by first navigating to https://████\n\n█████████\n\n2. I then guessed a meeting room name such as ███████ 'https://████/████████'. The meeting requests a meeting ID which is proceed to test test\n\n█████████\n\n3. Then click on 'open in your browser'\n\n██████\n\n███\n\n4. You are now in. Which is expected on normal occasions.. However... if you begin to notice.. These rooms are not expiring properly..\n\n██████████\n\n███\n\n██████████\n\n██████\n\n5. Since the scale of meetings was large, i only selected a handful of meetings to search through which i provided chat logs and files. Also i have brute forced a total of 300+ meeting rooms. Some were locked some were open.

This will also avoid people from invading into meetings such as teams and zoom bombings.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can use this information for malicious intentions such as blackmailing, phishing/spear phishing.
