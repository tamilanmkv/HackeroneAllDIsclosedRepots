Navigate to `ftp://████/pub/misc/FTP_██████Sign.exe.config` (establishes an anonymous FTP session on modern browsers)\n2. Verify credentials are in the `userSettings` XML section\n3. Establish an FTP connection to `████████` using the credentials\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nAnonymous FTP access should be disabled on `██████████` and the credentials exposed in the configuration file should be changed.","weakness":{"id":87,"name":"Insufficiently Protected Credentials"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":2,"voters":["cuso4","vivek_pancholi"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1719139,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
