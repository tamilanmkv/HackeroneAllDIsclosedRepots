They should NEVER appear as rendezvous points.\n\nHow this appears to be used for decloaking\n=========\n\nMost of the time I receive a valid rendezvous address:port.  It's only on rare cases that they are not known Tor nodes.\n\nFor these rare cases, as far as I can tell, these IP addresses are fake. There is no Tor-related service running on those ports, and often there is no server regardless of port.\n\nAnd yet... the connection from the Tor tunnel to the rendezvous point usually succeeds.\n\nHere is what I think is going on:\n1. A hostile hsdir negotiates a rendezvous point.  It supplies a valid fingerprint, but an invalid IP address. The IP address is nothing more than a tracking flag.\n\n2. If the hidden service uses a guard before accessing the rendezvous point, then the hostile guard (working in conjunction with the hostile hsdir) reroutes traffic to the correct IP. The hidden service never knows that this rerouting occurred. The attacker now knows the hidden service's real IP address.\n\n3. If the hidden service uses a guard and relay before accessing the rendezvous point, then the attacker needs to control three evil nodes: hsdir, relay, and guard. If the attacker doesn't own the guard, then the attacker still does the rerouting to the correct IP, but doesn't know the hidden service's address due to the guard.  NOTE: There are enough Tor nodes with unspecified owners and unspecified families (or with defined families that claim to be unrelated but actually have the same owners) that this attack is still very plausible.\n\n4. If the attacker does not own the guard or relay, then the IP address does not get rerouted to the correct address.  The connection fails and the user's system renegotiates a different rendezvous point.  NOTE: I have seen connections to these bad addresses fail and a follow-up negotiation for a different (working) rendezvous point.\n\nBesides uncloaking hidden services, this same technique could also uncloak users to the hidden services.\n\nSolution\n=========\nThe solution to this attack is pretty simple... If the signature, IP, and port does not exist in the cached-microdesc-consensus, then don't even attempt to connect. The rendezvous point should be rejected as invalid.","weakness":{"id":30,"name":"Man-in-the-Middle"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":1,"voters":["hackerfactor"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1994761,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello hackerfactor,\n\nthanks for the report and sorry for the attacks on your service.\n\nFirst of all, it's necessary for Tor to accept rendezvous points with unknown IP addresses, since not everyone in the network has the same consensus file. If hidden services only used known relays for rendezvous, it would create reachability issues if a client has a newer consensus and suggests an unknown relay to the HS.\n\nNow with regards to your analysis, I notice that all your harmful cases happen when the guard is hostile. That's expected. If the service's guard is hostile then bad things can happen anyway. Our guard algorithms (see proposal 271 and guard-spec.txt) are meant to protect against this, by picking the least amount of guards possible over time. Specifically, you should always be using the same one guard for many months, except if you have unstable internet.\n\nPlease also check proposal 247 for another attack that is sorta relevant to your situation but probably not related.\n\nAnyway, your report does not provide any new information or bugs. The behavior you are encountering is expected and should not deanonymize you or your users, except if you have a busted guard.\n\nPop on our IRC channel if you have any  questions about this.\n\nCheers and thanks for being a good service operator!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-09-13T16:39:15.648Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T16:39:15.648Z","actor":{"username":"asn","cleared":false,"url":"/asn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"torproject","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1994763,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Closing this as informative.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-09-13T16:39:38.042Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T16:39:38.042Z","actor":{"username":"asn","cleared":false,"url":"/asn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"torproject","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2083651,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-10-19T09:28:48.643Z","updated_at":"2017-10-19T09:28:48.643Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"geko","cleared":false,"url":"/geko","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"torproject","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2088303,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Already disclosed on my blog: http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/779-Behind-the-Tor-Attacks.html","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-10-20T14:28:39.213Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T14:28:39.213Z","actor":{"username":"hackerfactor","cleared":false,"url":"/hackerfactor","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/069/990/4826a26d83341c89c50de594442aec041043f7e7_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"torproject","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2088304,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-10-20T14:28:39.269Z","updated_at":"2017-10-20T14:28:39.269Z","actor":{"username":"hackerfactor","cleared":false,"url":"/hackerfactor","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/069/990/4826a26d83341c89c50de594442aec041043f7e7_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"torproject","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
