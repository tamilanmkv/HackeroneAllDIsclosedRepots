Fastly doesn't require any proof of DNS ownership to register new distributions that use a given domain, so I was able to effectively take it over.\n\nVulnerability: Subdomain Takeover via Fastly\nHost: http://registry.nodejs.org\n\nSolution:\nThere are two possible solutions to remediate this issue:\n\n1.) If you no longer wish to use registry.nodejs.org, you can simply delete the registry.nodejs.org CNAME record that is currently pointing to registry.npmjs.org.\n\n2.) Alternatively, if you would like to continue using and/or supporting registry.nodejs.org, you can coordinate with me, I will delete my Fastly service so that someone from nodejs.org can add the registry.nodejs.org domain to the \"Domains\" field in the related Fastly service.  This should be done in a timely and coordinated fashion to prevent another researcher (or less savory type) from registering it before you are able to.\n\n## Impact\n\nSince discovering this vulnerability I have received more than 300 requests for various npm packages. A malicious attacker could have used this access to begin delivering backdoored (or otherwise malicious) packages to users who were not using the correct registry setting of registry.npmjs.org.","weakness":{"id":30,"name":"Man-in-the-Middle"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-06-03T09:03:23.284Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-105947071.88166778,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":33,"voters":["sat0shi","jokebookservice1","chalker","kapytein","muon4","bl4de","spam404","fpatrik","bugdiscloseguys","eveeez","and 23 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2639506,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for your report!
