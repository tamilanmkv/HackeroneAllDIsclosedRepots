We've taken an action item to clarify the program's policy.

We'll never be perfectly consistent here as a large part of this assessment is based on probability.\n\nIn the case of #55017, that amount was for 10 different vulnerabilities, most of which were awarded the minimum $500 (we've since implemented a policy to require each vulnerability to be submitted individually to avoid this confusion).\n\nIf you still believe this issue has higher impact than we've reflected here, you can best help us by demonstrating RCE in a production application:\n\n\u003e If you believe this assessment is inaccurate, could you please demonstrate a PoC against any common (widely-deployed) application?\n\nThank you.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-09-28T03:56:56.506Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T03:56:56.506Z","actor":{"username":"arice","cleared":false,"url":"/arice","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/020/83152cb2d070f3f6a63c1b61bae47257722b5ad2_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1220585,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi,\n\nDon't tell me that seem i did not know anything.
