Intel Product Security Team,\n\nGood Afternoon.\n\nFirstly, I would like to thank you for responding, I sincerely appreciate it.\n\nSecondly, I disagree with the CVSS V3 Base Score of 3.3 because of the following:-\n\n1) Availability should be High and cannot be None, since there is a clear and always reproducible crash (DoS) of the vulnerable software.\n\n2) Integrity should be High and not Low, because this is a clear Out of Bounds \"Write\" issue allowing an attacker to modify resources.\n\n3) The attack complexity should be Low and cannot be High, since all an attacker needs to do is send a trace file to the victim for processing.\n\n4) Privileges Required should be None and not Low, since the attacker does not need any privileges to send the malicious trace file to the victim for processing.\n\nThereby the correct CVSS score is 7.3 and the vector string for the same is https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:H\n\nTherefore, I would like to kindly request you to re-review the aforementioned CVSS vector string and the reasons mentioned above.\n\nAlso I will be abiding by the coordinated public disclosure date of June 11th 2019 and we will be publishing our Advisory for this issue on June 12th 2019, by which date this Vulnerability should most likely be patched by Intel Corporation.\n\nAlso I would like to request you to share

How could a Memory Corruption Vulnerability in an Intel Product priced at $2949 with a valid Vulnerability have a severity set as None?\n\n2) You mentioned that \"This reward is outside of the normal criteria for our Bug Bounty program, which is focused on rewarding valid security vulnerabilities in Intel products, and should be considered an exception.\" BUT, I noticed a similar Vulnerability (Heap Overflow local vector) in the Same Product reported by another Hackerone Researcher and Acknowledged by Intel Security Team in 2018. The link to the Intel Security Advisory is https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00180.html, bearing CVE ID CVE-2018-12174 and the respective Researcher was https://hackerone.com/jplopezy. Could you please explain \n\n3) I have several more Vulnerabilities in Intel VTune Amplifier, Intel Trace Analyzer, Intel System Studio, Intel Parallel Studio, Intel OpenVINO toolkit, Intel Quartus Prime, Intel Media Server Studio and several other Intel Paid Products. Are they also Out-Of-Scope for the Intel Bug Bounty Program? \n\n4) Both this report #483572 and  #483573 are different since the Binaries in question are different, the PoCs are different, the crash location is different. One report is for the \"Intel Trace Collector Application\" and the other is for the \"Intel Trace Analyzer Application\". Could you share the root cause as to how report #483573 was closed as Duplicate of this report. \n\nI am attaching both the 2018 Intel Advisory for this \"Same product\" and the Hackerone Researcher's profile page who reported that other Vulnerability to Intel Security Team along with this comment.\n\nIt is extremely disheartening to see Intel first downplay the Severity in the CVSS scoring, thereafter merge two distinctly different issues into one and thereafter say that the Vulnerability is out of normal scope and an exception is being made when clearly a similar vulnerability in the same product has been fixed and acknowledged by Intel just 3 months ago. \n\nI hope some clarity can be brought into this matter, so that I can responsibly report the other findings I have found \"if they are in scope of this program without any exceptions\".\n\nEagerly awaiting your response.\n\nThanking You,\n\nYours Sincerely,\nKushal Arvind Shah.\nSenior Security Researcher | Fortinet's
