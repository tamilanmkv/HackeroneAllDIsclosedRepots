In these cases, the feature need not provide any actual security benefit, just satisfy the letter of the policy. Installs which have expressed interest in encryption from this angle have generally not actually cared that the encryption is provable, secure, observable, or even that it protects against any specific attack scenario: they're just following a policy that says encryption is good.\n\nWe have not implemented the feature to address these cases, although we've probably seen more of these cases than \"S3 vs Trusted Datacenter\" cases. Particularly, we specifically avoided implementing the unprovable \"encrypt data\" S3 checkbox that AWS offers (you can find some discussion in \u003chttps://secure.phabricator.com/D10176\u003e) in favor of a scheme which at least protects against some set of attackers, however implausible it may be that Chinese commandos are going to storm an AWS datacenter.\n\nI think there may be a legitimate -- if somewhat far-fetched -- attack here:\n\n  - Compromise the file storage engine (e.g., S3) and gain read and write access.\n  - Compromise a Phabricator user account.\n  - You can only use Phabricator as a padding oracle for files your user account can read, so identify some readable file which you can trick a more privileged user into executing (`trustworthy.exe`).\n  - Conduct a padding oracle attack by writing blocks into S3 and reading from the web UI. You can read the file, so you have the plaintext, and you control S3 so you have the cipher text, and can rewrite the cipher text. You do not control an application server so you do not have the IV or encryption key. Note that each 4MB block of each file uses a unique key and IV, so I believe you can't do any kind of sideways attack where you use your permission on some files to compromise other files. Nor can you directly attack the master encryption key on the keyring.\n  - Your goal is to use the padding oracle to discover the correct ciphertext for an alternate binary (`evil.exe`) so you can replace the ciphertext on disk. I'm unsure if this is actually possible. If it is, I'm unsure if it's practical. For example, you must make a web request for each query to the oracle, and that request must make a service call to S3 and load the blob, so even a relatively low-complexity attack might be stretched to an unrealistically long timeframe.\n  - Once you've discovered the ciphertext for `evil.exe`, you replace it on disk in S3 and then wait for your victim to download and execute the file from Phabricator (or encourage them to do so).\n\nThis requires you to compromise S3 and a user account, but be unable to compromise an application host (if you could, you could just read the encryption key). State attackers raiding datacenters probably don't have time to conduct this attack and would have to separately compromise an account.\n\nAn employee might more reasonably have an account and be able to gain AWS credentials to access S3. These credentials should normally be stored alongside the keyring and subject to the same security protocols, but realistically installs probably use AWS for more things than Phabricator and may not set up single-use credentials for it. In most cases this probably boils down to a social engineering attack where the major compromise is convincing a privileged coworker to run a binary. Perhaps this oracle-based approach could tip the balance and let this attack succeed where it would otherwise fail, but I don't think routine workflows normally lead users to regularly execute binaries from Phabricator or place any particular trust in them.\n\nWhether this attack is actually possible or not, I think checksumming blobs is probably worth implementing anyway.

Thank you for taking the time to explain everything thoroughly.** I will brake my response down and address individual parts of your response.\n\n\u003e Storing file blobs encrypted in S3 protects these installs against attacks by AWS employees or attackers who can mount an attack on an AWS datacenter directly (in an extreme case, state actors storming an AWS facility and taking hardware by force). This encryption reduces the amount of trust which needs to be placed in S3/AWS.\n\nOK, so while very unlikely, a rogue AWS employee could potentially exploit this vulnerability without having to have access to the victim's Phabricator account.\n\n\u003e In other cases, installs don't actually care about security or any specific attack, but have a policy which requires or encourages data to be stored encrypted. In these cases, the feature need not provide any actual security benefit, just satisfy the letter of the policy. Installs which have expressed interest in encryption from this angle have generally not actually cared that the encryption is provable, secure, observable, or even that it protects against any specific attack scenario: they're just following a policy that says encryption is good.\n\nThis raises a new issue for me. Although Phabricator is not directly to blame here, no encryption is almost better than \"bad\" encryption, since this could potentially give another user (keep in mind I am using the term user to define somebody setting up their own installation of Phabricator) a false sense of security. I will come back to this later on. [1]\n\n\u003e We have not implemented the feature to address these cases, although we've probably seen more of these cases than \"S3 vs Trusted Datacenter\" cases. Particularly, we specifically avoided implementing the unprovable \"encrypt data\" S3 checkbox that AWS offers (you can find some discussion in https://secure.phabricator.com/D10176) in favor of a scheme which at least protects against some set of attackers, however implausible it may be that Chinese commandos are going to storm an AWS datacenter.\n\nFair enough.\n\n\u003e I think there may be a legitimate -- if somewhat far-fetched -- attack here: [...]\n\nI will come back to this when reevaluating the severity of the issue. [2]\n\n\u003e An employee might more reasonably have an account and be able to gain AWS credentials to access S3.

Perhaps this oracle-based approach could tip the balance and let this attack succeed where it would otherwise fail, but I don't think routine workflows normally lead users to regularly execute binaries from Phabricator or place any particular trust in them.\n\nSo this is where I go back to [1]. If I understood correctly you only mention social engineering an AWS employee, but I believe the false sense of security could mean that the attacker may have an easier time trying to trick the user.\n\n\u003e Whether this attack is actually possible or not, I think checksumming blobs is probably worth implementing anyway. It may not really defuse any attack here, but there's some value in just having an integrity checksum and it's not particularly difficult to implement.\n\nThis is a very good idea, but at the same time you should add an authentication mechanism. Some users may ignore checksum mismatches and completely rely on the decryption process ensuring integrity.\n\n\u003e But I'd like better evidence that this attack represents a real threat rather than a purely theoretical one before prioritizing this as a security issue.\n\nFinally, I am still confident that this issues could be exploited in combination with other issues, such as the false sense of security. Therefore, to help you prioritise this security issue we should use the following CVSS score: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N` -\u003e **2.2 (Low)** [2]\n\nThe attack scenarios are all hard to pull off (`AC:H`) and the attacker requires high privileges in order to mount the attack (`PR:H`).\n\n\u003e Can you construct a more concerning attack?\n\nNo. I can only make the two first steps easier with the false sense of security and possibly combining other vulnerabilities. \n\nAfter doing a little research I found a similar [report](https://hackerone.com/reports/108082) that still requires high user privileges, but demonstrates bit flipping an executable fairly well.

(This is why I resisted implementing the unprovable S3 \"Encryption\" header.)\n\n\u003e OK, so while very unlikely, a rogue AWS employee could potentially exploit this vulnerability without having to have access to the victim's Phabricator account.\n\nI think they can't realistically build a poisoned ciphertext because we operate in CBC mode -- see below.\n\n\u003e This is a very good idea, but at the same time you should add an authentication mechanism. Some users may ignore checksum mismatches and completely rely on the decryption process ensuring integrity.\n\nOh, I think we're talking about the same thing: I mean that we would store an HMAC hash of each chunk of file data when writing, and refuse to decrypt it if the hash of the ciphertext we read did not match the stored hash (that is, \"Encrypt-then-MAC\").\n\nOn hash mismatch, we'd give the user an error message (like \"This file has been corrupted or tampered with and can not be read.\"). We wouldn't just tell users to manually compare checksums, since I agree that almost no one would do that.\n\n\u003e After doing a little research I found a similar report that still requires high user privileges, but demonstrates bit flipping an executable fairly well. Please note that the payload would still only be 16 bytes in CBC mode. What do you think? Is this still impractical?\n\nI *think* this attack relies on CFB mode, and won't work in CBC mode? In CBC mode, I think you have to search through the entire space for the block and that having a padding oracle doesn't help you, because a one-bit change in the ciphertext cascades to the entire plaintext output block. I may be misunderstanding or unaware of an attack which allows you to reduce the search space, but my belief is that:\n\n  - Given a ciphertext which you want to corrupt, you have to search 2^128 inputs to find a ciphertext which decrypts to a plaintext with 16 chosen bytes if the encryption uses CBC mode with 128-bit blocks.\n  - Having access to a padding oracle doesn't help you narrow down this search space.\n  - In CFB mode (instead of CBC mode), this search is trivial (bit operations on the ciphertext directly impact the decrypted plaintext, so you can construct the poisoned ciphertext directly), which is why the linked attack is realistic.\n\nAssuming I'm not missing anything, you have to search a huge space because we use CBC, and the oracle doesn't help you do this, and verifying a candidate ciphertext takes 100ms+ even if you have a Phabricator account (you have to make an HTTP request and get a response). So I don't think a users with access to S3 or an AWS employee can realistically build a poisoned ciphertext before the heat death of the universe.\n\nMaybe you can compromise S3 and an account, and find a way to tamper with a binary so you only need to change a few bits, and can arrange things so those bits appear at the beginning of a block, and the binary format allows you to corrupt the rest of the file. Then you could verify your poisoned ciphertext in a realistic amount of time. This seems like a very high barrier, but perhaps not an insurmountable one.\n\nOr maybe this attack is easier than I think, but I *believe* using CBC mode makes us mostly resistant to it.\n\nIf users really can blindly construct a chosen plaintext without searching a huge input space, I'd consider this attack sufficiently realistic to place high priority on fixing it in the short term.\n\n\u003e Once again, thank you very much for helping me understand the issue.

This is not the world's cleanest proof-of-concept, but the shape of the attack is as described above:\n\n  - We use the oracle to discover the plaintext in the second block (in Phabricator, this is not necessary because you can read the plaintext if you can query the oracle, but an oracle plus the ciphertext is sufficient in the general case).\n  - We use the oracle and the discovered plaintext to poison the second block so it decrypts to chosen plaintext.\n  - Although this script doesn't demonstrate it, I believe we can continue working backward to poison an arbitrarily long suffix of the file (but not the entire file).\n  - We end up with one block of garbage which we can not control before any sections we poison, but it's reasonable that this may be acceptable (the ownCloud example is illustrative). I think getting rid of this garbage block is legitimately hard (you really have to search the whole space) but attackers can just build attacks where this doesn't matter.\n  - In the worst case, we only need ~4,000 queries to the oracle per 16-byte block, which is a realistic number of queries to execute even against a network oracle to meaningfully poison a file.\n\nI think there are still a lot of barriers to overcome, but this was the biggest one by a wide margin.
