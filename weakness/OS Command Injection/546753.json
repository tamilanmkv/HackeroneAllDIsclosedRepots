This PoC of RCE was performed over a Demo Instance running the latest version of NextClou.\n\nTo achieve RCE over Demo Instance 2 payloads were needed:\n\na) The attacker needs to force the application to download a Perl Reverse Shell to /tmp folder using curl, this was achieved using the following HTTP Request:\n\nNote: \nMy server IP is: 138.68.1.244\n\nHTTP Request:\n```\nPOST

It is a great and well written report, thank you for your efforts in that and sorry some of our responses might come across a little snarky. I'm sure it was not meant that way, but the nature of online communication sometimes loses some subtlety.\n\nWith regards to the decision to not pay anything out, our policy and list of in-scope and out-of-scope issues is very clear, I think: https://hackerone.com/nextcloud\n\nWe explicitly list everything that is in scope and say that everything else is not. I hope you understand that we can not take responsibility for the code of all third parties who develop apps (well over 200!) for Nextcloud, and thus have not included this in the scope of our bug bounty program. I strongly suggest that next time, before you put significant effort into an issue you found, you first see if the issue is covered under the bug bounty program.\n\nWith regards to the relevancy to the Nextcloud ecosystem, I did have a quick look at the downloads of the Extract app. According to the github statistics, it has a little over 6000 downloads:\nhttps://www.somsubhra.com/github-release-stats/?username=PaulLereverend\u0026repository=NextcloudExtract\nAs we estimate there are about 300.000 Nextcloud servers in total, the app might have been installed (though perhaps also again disabled) on at most about 2-4% of those. So while it is certainly a serious issue that ought to be fixed, it should not impact that many users. Moreover, we generally urge our customers (who are a tiny percentage of the total user base of servers above) to consult with us before installing in-official apps.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry you feel your report is mishandled. I hope you understand we take security serious but can only take responsibility for the code we wrote and support for our customers.\n\nGreetings","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-05-31T07:44:11.142Z","updated_at":"2019-05-31T07:44:11.142Z","actor":{"username":"jospoortvliet","cleared":false,"url":"/jospoortvliet","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/157/026/ba1ff99473a0813cefa3caa994e3c28ed37d045d_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"nextcloud","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4958633,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"A clarification, as I see you mentioned that we list the domain apps.nextcloud.com as in scope.\n\nAll source code/apps which are covered can be found in the list of what is in scope.

You can find the source code of the app store here: https://github.com/nextcloud/appstore\n\nHackerOne is quite clear on the difference between domains and source code. A domain covers hacking the server(s) running there using the code they run - it doesn't mean to cover anything that is hosted on that domain and everything you could do with whatever is hosted there.\n\nCompare it to github - github would of course cover with bounties anyone who breaks into their server running on github.com. They would NOT cover any bounties on any of the security issues in any of the millions of software projects hosted on github.com!\n\nWRT the number of vulnerable systems, let's note that the attacker needs an account on the system, or be able to guess a public upload link.
