Injected commands are executed on the container host, not within a Docker container, as such could compromise all future builds which are executed by the runner.\n\n## Details\n\nWhen using a `docker` executor, the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` build variable is processed as a JSON docker config file. One of the possible config values, `credHelpers`, specifies a hash of repository keys to docker Credential Helper application values. \n\n```json\n{\n  \"credHelpers\" : {\n    \"repo.example.com\" : \"application\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen `gitlab-runner` attempts to create an image, each key value pair in the `credHelpers` hash is processed, and the corresponding Credential Helper application is executed by `gitlab-runner` in order to obtain credentials for the repository. This execution occurs on the docker container host, `gitlab-runner` directly `exec`s the Credential Helper to receive it's output.\n\nDocker Credential Helpers, as processed by the `github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials/native_store.go:NewNativeStore` function are prepended with the string `docker-credential-` before execution:\n\n```go\n// github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials/native_store.go\nconst (\n\tremoteCredentialsPrefix = \"docker-credential-\"\n\ttokenUsername           = \"\u003ctoken\u003e\"\n)\n\n...\n\nfunc NewNativeStore(file store, helperSuffix string) Store {\n\tname := remoteCredentialsPrefix + helperSuffix\n\treturn \u0026nativeStore{\n\t\tprogramFunc: client.NewShellProgramFunc(name),\n\t\tfileStore:   NewFileStore(file),\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThis is sufficient to prevent command injection on *nix based systems, however Windows based systems can exploit path traversal to execute arbitrary programs as Credential Helpers. E.G. a `credHelper` of `{\"helper\" : :/../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/calc.exe\"}` would result in the application `docker-credential-/../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/calc.exe` being executed, which on a Windows system would resolve to `C:/Windows/System32/calc.exe`. This only affects Windows based systems, as Windows does not verify path directories exist during path normalization. In this case, Windows does not check the directory `docker-credential-` exists as it is normalized out due to the path traversal characters following it.\n\nThe Credential Helper execution is ultimately called in the `gitlab-runner` code by `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/helpers/docker/auth/auth.go:readConfigsFromCredentialsHelper` calling the `github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials/native_store.go:Get` `docker` API method:\n\n```go\n// gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/helpers/docker/auth/auth.go\nfunc readConfigsFromCredentialsHelper(config *configfile.ConfigFile) (map[string]types.AuthConfig, error) {\n\thelpersAuths := make(map[string]types.AuthConfig)\n\n\tfor registry, helper := range config.CredentialHelpers {\n\t\tstore := credentials.NewNativeStore(config, helper)\n\n\t\tnewAuths, err := store.Get(registry)\n```\n\nThe issue exists as the `gitlab-runner` code does not check for path traversals in Credential Helper values before passing them to the `docker` API.\n\nIn it's simplest form, this issue can be exploited to execute any program that exists on the system running `gitlab-runner` with uncontrolled arguments. However, arbitrary programs can be executed by setting up a `service` which downloads an executable payload to the `C:\\Builds` volume mounted directory, and setting the full path to the volume mounted directory as the `credHelper` value, e.g.:\n```json\n{\n  \"helper\" : \"/../../../../../../../../ProgramData/docker/volumes/runner-aapjznsw-project-20444930-concurrent-0-cache-cde2929a41401004cf47d36bdb2eb380/_data/testfile.exe\"\n}\n```\n\nThis works as the following three conditions are met:\n1. The source of the volume mounted `build` directory is predictable per build\n1. The `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` is processed once for each created container\n1. The build container is created after all `service` containers have been started.\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n* Register and run a runner on a Windows system with a docker executor and a tag of `windows-docker-runner`.\n* Create a Build with the following `.gitlab-ci.yml`:\n\n```yml\nservices:\n  - alpasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfidne:3.5\nvariables:\n  DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG: \"{\\\"credHelpers\\\" : {\\\"repo.example.com\\\" : \\\"/../../../../../../../../Windows/System32/calc.exe\\\"}}\"\n\nbuild1:\n  tags:\n    - windows-docker-runner\n  stage: build\n  script:\n    - whoami\n```\n\nWhen `gitlab-runner` picks up the build it will process the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` json and launch the CredentialHelper specified, in this case `calc.exe`.\n\nConfirmed vulnerable version configurations are:\n* gitlab-runner 13.2.2 on Windows 10 with Docker Toolbox (`docker` runner)\n* gitlab-runner 13.2.2 on Windows 2019 with Docker Enterprise (`docker-windows` runner)\n\n## Impact\n\nExploitation of this issue could compromise the underlying system on which `gitlab-runner` runs, exposing source code, build artifacts and other sensitive data to a malicious user.\n\n## What is the current *bug* behavior?\n\ngitlab-runner passes unsanitized JSON values from the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` build variable to the `github.com/docker/cli/cli/config/credentials/native_store.go:NewNativeStore` `docker` API function, which may result in command injection on Windows systems.\n\n## What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nJSON supplied via the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` build variable should be processed to ensure it does not contain malicious content.\n\n## Relevant logs and/or screenshots\n\n{F943021}\n\n## Output of checks\n\n`gitlab-runner --version`\n```\nVersion:      13.2.2\nGit revision:
