User has to use a Gecko based browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox)\n2. User has to open a link sent by the adversary\n3. User has to click on the small \"Download\" button in the top right of the PDF viewer.\n\nOnce an user has performed this step they are redirected to the URL passed as a GET parameter.\n\nNote: The user will be displayed a warning that the PDF file can't be loaded properly.\n\n## Affected software\n- ownCloud Server \u003c 7.0.14 (CVE assignment pending)\n\t- files_pdfviewer/c69858a421b2cad219a0ea580c1ef4e0e2c9877f\n- ownCloud Server \u003c 8.0.12 (CVE assignment pending)\n\t- files_pdfviewer/54b78d9053dac0195adbebb23dad71d43ab2f6b2\n- ownCloud Server \u003c 8.1.7 (CVE assignment pending)\n\t- files_pdfviewer/31d4e53fe6e47353c1e7ba15ed07df29e1c174c9\n- ownCloud Server \u003c 8.2.4 (CVE assignment pending)\n\t- files_pdfviewer/9ab7ca2e5eabea43d18b97d4622ebea30fa09a92\n- ownCloud Server \u003c 9.0.2 (CVE assignment pending)\n\t- files_pdfviewer/a1445f0f8bf28eed89c1f56682bbb6fe574b4ecf\n\n## Action Taken\n\nThe PDF viewer has been configured that it can only be opened via iframes. Since as a clickjacking attack the X-Frame-Options header is employed as well this doesn't make it possible to send users anymore malicious links.\n\nAs a further step for the 9.1 release of ownCloud the following changes are planned to mitigate such attack vectors even more:\n\n1. Update the PDF.js library to a version that supports whitelisting of target domains. For reference please see https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/pull/6916\n2. Employ Same-Site-Cookies with a strict policy on this endpoint. Browsers supporting Same-Site-Cookies will not make it possible to access such resources directly anymore. For reference please see https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/24092\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe ownCloud team thanks the following people for their research and responsible disclosure of the above advisory:\n\n- Businessprotect.gr (info@businessprotect.gr) - Vulnerability discovery and disclosure.\n```\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-04T07:52:26.259Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T07:52:26.259Z","actor":{"username":"lukasreschke","cleared":false,"url":"/lukasreschke","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/037/891/e7fea4d5383dc07d1fe767b02f3bda2bc7639c63_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"owncloud","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":939839,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Since this has been resolved I'll mark this accordingly.
