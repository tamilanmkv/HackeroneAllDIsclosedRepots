The link https://twitter.com/i/flow shows up an error message with an OK button\n 2. When you are not logged in, clicking in that OK button takes you back to twitter.com\n 3. But if you open that link when you are logged in, clicking on OK takes you to the page from where you are routed to twitter.\n 4. This simplifies phishing attack where an attacker can take user to malicious page on clicking OK button on twitter.\n\nPS: This may not be an Open redirect using URL but a redirection that could simplify phishing attacks (CWE-601)\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Save  the following code as HTML file\n  2. Login to twitter and in other tab of same browser open the HTML file\n  3. Click on the link \"Click here\"\n  4. You are then taken to twitter and an error message is shown\n  5. Click OK\n  6.

In this case, the webpage `https://twitter.com/i/flow` will display an error which when clicked will redirect users to the last site they visited which in this case is the attacker's POC. Your POC page then detects if a user has visited their site before and redirects the victim to an arbitrary site using the `window.location.replace()` function.\n\nAt the moment, it seems this behavior can only be used in phishing attacks. Typically, we do not accept phishing attacks unless they demonstrate an extremely convincing phishing behavior. Although a victim will navigate to Twitter before being redirected to the attacker's site, we are unsure how this will help your phishing attack. Especially, since victims must navigate to the attacker's site, click a button, before being redirected to a blank Twitter error page.\n\nCan you explain how an attacker can use this behavior to create a convincing phishing attack? \n\nThank you for thinking of Twitter security.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-01-24T01:32:09.141Z","updated_at":"2020-01-24T01:32:59.712Z","actor":{"username":"bugtriage-sophia","cleared":false,"url":"/bugtriage-sophia","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":true},{"id":6861369,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNew","message":"Hi @bugtriage-sophia ,\n\n1. Initially I thought that attacker would display something on his webpage that contains twitter's \"Follow/Connect to twitter/Login With Twitter/Tweet\" buttons instead of that Click here link in PoC and those buttons do all this.\n\n2. But as I said I could automate the click process as well, now all that attacker does is tweet a link which when opened displays an error message on twitter. Any normal user would think that it is a genuine error message from twitter and it is. And he does not expect clicking OK on twitter takes him to any other website.\nNow on the screen where error message is displayed user can only do two things. Either click OK or hit back on browser tab.\nInterestingly both actions land the user on attacker's twitter look alike page.\n\n                     Twitter \u003e\u003e Attacker page (invisible) \u003e\u003e Twitter (error message) \u003e\u003e Phishing site\n\n\nTo achieve this use the follow code as HTML file and open it in the same browser where twitter is logged in.\n\n```\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003cbody\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/i/flow\" id=\"forceClick\" onClick=\"forceClicked()\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \n\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003cscript\u003e\n\nfunction forceClicked(){\nlocalStorage.setItem(\"ClickCount\", 1);  //Setting up a value in local storage to detected user click\n}\n\n\nif(localStorage.getItem(\"ClickCount\")==1)\n   {\n      localStorage.setItem(\"ClickCount\", 0); \n      if(localStorage.getItem(\"ClickCount\")==0) \n         {\n            window.location.replace(\"https://hackerone.com/twitter\");  //This can any attacker controlled website\n         }\n\t\t \n\t \n   }\nelse {\n\ndocument.getElementById(\"forceClick\").click();\n\n}\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\n##With this, the victim does not see any attacker page or he does not have to click any link.
