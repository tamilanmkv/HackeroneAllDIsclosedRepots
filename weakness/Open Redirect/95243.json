One way to fix this bug would be to ensure that the logic is the same for choosing which param to use to display the profile, and for which user to follow after form submission. It may be that this is already the case, but that the line termination is getting filtered out and this is confusing this logic somehow. Another, perhaps simpler way to fix this would be to accept either a username or an ID as a single param and infer type.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-10-23T00:14:58.970Z","updated_at":"2015-10-23T00:17:16.336Z","actor":{"username":"ericr","cleared":false,"url":"/ericr","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/019/965/8e3881ef9e10824c3f2e34adb21290c7d4db79d1_original.jpeg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":629156,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Correction: It was the other issue I submitted that used a line termination.
