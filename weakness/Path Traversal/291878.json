Upload image via media menu e.g. new\n2. Go to edit post (old fashioned way)\n3. Grad the `id`, `_wpnonce` and choose your payload `../../../../wp-config.php`\n4. Craft your payload(set auth cookies, ua, referrers, ...): \n```\ncurl 'http://localhost/ripsa/wpvuln/wp-admin/post.php?post=[your_postid]\u0026action=editattachment\u0026_wpnonce=[yournonce]' -H 'place your client headers: ua, cookies in order to mimic the authenticated user ' -d 'thumb=../../../../wp-config-slavco.php' --compressed \n```\n5. Delete the file from the admin\n\nImpact:\n1. Requires user that have permission to manipulate media files / posts\n2. Hard to be spotted because:\n2.1 Payload is deleted from DB\n2.2 `@unlink` won't rise error in case of any failed attempts\n3. Affects many blogging/publishing, e-commerce, ...  setups.\n\nAttack:\n1. Delete `wp-config.php` and relaunch wp setup with remote attackers db - RCE \n2. Delete `.htaccess` or any another `index.html`/`index.php` in order to disclose any stored data under web accessible directory\n","weakness":{"id":19,"name":"Path Traversal"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-08-29T13:47:01.687Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-98412749.12894738,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":16,"voters":["hunter","inhibitor181","sameerphad72","mik317","r4v","muhammad_uwais","eveeez","an0nym0us","apapedulimu","mefkan","and 6 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","score":9.9,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":2750,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"WordPress Core","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2170709,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @slavco, thank you for reporting this to us.

Between school, work, family, and the holidays, I haven't had as much time as I would have hoped to work on this. Initially I thought we could just call `validate_file` on the file path, but currently relative paths are allowed and to disallow all relative paths could break quite a few sites. @jjj had a good idea regarding this. He suggested migrating everything to `wp_delete_file` and not allowing anything outside of ABSPATH to be deleted (with blacklists for wp-config.php and other sensitive files). We could then add a filter to allow those who have WP_CONTENT_DIR outside of ABSPATH to keep working.\n\n\u003e but I really doubt it would be taken into consideration :)\nRegarding that, I'm all ears for you suggestions.

If we _are_ going to introduce a safety measure to prevent critical file deletion (and my personal opinion is that we should) that fix should be handled globally, in such a way that plugins and themes opting into using `wp_delete_file()` would be protected, and outside of this fix specifically.\n\nPlugins or themes calling `unlink()` directly will always be free to behave badly, and WordPress should provide the best tooling within itself as an application to prevent accidents, while trusting the rest of the server to be configured in such a way that important application files (like WordPress core files) cannot be blindly unlinked.\n\n----\n\nMy attached patch is a backwards compatibility break. Plugins attempting to pass a relative file path to this very-old `'thumb'` parameter (normally only accessed via a pre-3.0 admin screen) will now fail, but I believe that break is worth it here, given both the age of that code and how unlikely it is to be relied upon in the wild.\n\nWe try to get consensus from the team when backwards compatibility breaks are necessary. It's also possible my suggested fix is not the best approach, but this is my progress from tonight so I wanted to update everyone.\n\n----\n\nIt's hard to put into words how frustrating and embarrassing it is for issues to go stale like this one did, from both sides of the issue fwiw. I'm sorry this went ignored. I know my apology means very little, but it needs to be said and I do feel all of these things.\n\nWhen there is progress, one of us will update here.\n\nThanks,\n-JJJ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-06-27T01:58:28.682Z","updated_at":"2018-06-27T02:00:30.401Z","actor":{"username":"jjj","cleared":false,"url":"/jjj","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/007/063/b21324cc7d9861888c1ddd4fa345cda6612361ff_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"attachments":[{"id":312748,"filename":"editattachment.patch","type":"text/x-diff","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/312/748/ce8c0fc2d4bfc7f8e3614b7fe25634e814e17c18/editattachment.patch?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22editattachment.patch%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27editattachment.patch\u0026response-content-type=text%2Fx-diff\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ67VGDS6J%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T143930Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIBUTJ%2BNbh3iGCDafndtBQHkqG1OchqwWgdsmguvhgcLdAiAZVuUXVW1VaXDOlTKJW4MkHKw5%2BpgOTsVzeaztjAVXniqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMAWL4B0QSi4hczgSpKtcD3VOAKPL2y75%2FC3vWJu4CxM2H0MhpokFUEt9l4V7Gq%2BkP2JZRIvSX1xKqm2Gk%2BJRjjqXa9QVImay%2FdjekrRmCYTSSDt9dxM0L0oVJr7N6F8ODRv2P7lMfnzU0QMlpmHbiPpiQb5vSlaxU6jX1ESO3u1VQpKIm%2B7BGH6YiJgHcf9pDdPJ24QxGmfk3jwQevnf60P1KEwb1KLJ2JtKpPhawQ8CP%2Fp%2B8Udd6EL0VEe2hP01M49Skdizp3cnpjBBz%2FKaJPQOVb%2FxLwhTaiAm4Gs7LWex0SieNQGn7QnS8LjaHWQ69N6yv2yl5daZ0uO8CMISq44OuSORn5NNfE6Wx49Y1QtLur%2BY0bpfImT2%2Bc3AvhGI16NMEhk5qpUfU2p6NU4IF0P6m2durenSRqQWtxyQafE31VSJU%2FhpOLcgkiLcYO84tTOPewOIMl9iBrNtCggjBX8%2FrEvRnKduv0F4uzhgiTrLXMqiHsoMRJfAlsnKSaskF2MN%2FW8oUK%2Fx2WHxpYJSGLi98vCnAnrjkI1O0VdepFdfxg4xzpi25EpMuF10ISO7%2BOVlPuH4gcxSmKXq2nnWHAyNBbYGCcXKMdnH%2BrKVSQO3JfLw8lTFoTNA9axFJVvLPV3N6%2FondMJKHkYsGOqYBXTEQgnOCUR6Njz81XybrbzJvU1Pc2hk4bMTrt1%2BCSeA%2FbFO392%2FoWlFJGmK4bl3JexiICV3H2r69Blx%2FAIbSxJ4%2Bl1Ric4x9veCmMmxtb3M7uvCDvG9rrJjEd5V99ttvzT1tURyLC0o%2FETycAhpeR4E%2BNiVWXOm1S8L2NA83yPbiobo0yaywdayHxWpEhNSXoJ8gkKAiNtIC0AZekCrrrdnKzbLEBw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=f94cee439e4e16cf6dcbf9e18063e753926d948f631ac31ffa2ae9fe89ecdd60"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"wordpress","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2939831,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Speaking as me/Slavco personally:\n \nIf you take into consideration the input sanitation approach then you should make sure every place in the core where postmeta key inserting is possible to be sanitized in case of \"thumb\" key.
