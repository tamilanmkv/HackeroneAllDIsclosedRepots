So of course I wanted to see what would happen if we would enter an absolute path, since then I could bypass the extension check entirely.\n\n```\n\tpublic function get_type_of_file_path( $file_path = '' ) {\n\t\t$file_path = $file_path ? $file_path : $this-\u003eget_file();\n\t\tif ( 0 === strpos( $file_path, 'http' ) || 0 === strpos( $file_path, '//' ) ) {\n\t\t\treturn 'absolute';\n\t\t} elseif ( '[' === substr( $file_path, 0, 1 ) \u0026\u0026 ']' === substr( $file_path, -1 ) ) {\n\t\t\treturn 'shortcode';\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\treturn 'relative';\n\t\t}\n\t}\n```\n\nAnd I was right. Funny enough, input is only an absolute path if it starts with two slashes. So all I did was  to set the download file to //home/simon/html/wordpress/wp-config.php and then just downloaded it.\n\nAs a patch recommendation: Also check the file types if it is an absolute path.\n\nBest regards,\nSimon\n\n## Impact\n\nWhen an attacker can download the wp-config.php file, a privilege escalation is easily possible. He could either log into the database if the DB host is not localhost or if the WordPress installation is used with a shared hosting provider, he can simply get some hosting space on the same server and then access the database, which leads to a complete compromise of the installation.","bounty_amount":"350.0","formatted_bounty":"$350","weakness":{"id":19,"name":"Path Traversal"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-12-19T14:23:55.421Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-57198747.11607625,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":15,"voters":["mashoud1122","sameerphad72","ali","realtess","t4ym","cryptographer","dolph1n","facelessdevhack","mahelsay","r1pp3r_","and 5 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3265179,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for the report, we're investigating.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-08-29T18:24:37.031Z","updated_at":"2018-08-29T18:24:37.031Z","actor":{"username":"vortfu","cleared":false,"url":"/vortfu","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/982/1ef285fb263d30f189dc6a8038e1d5c46086e9d9_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"automattic","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3289645,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I have also just realized that it is also possible to simply enter http://localhost/wordpress/wp-config.php?ext=.jpg and download arbitrary files this way.

For download URLs that begin with `//` the correct behavior should always be to treat that as a URL and never to treat that as a path (e.g. for the download URL `//home/simon/html/wordpress/wp-config.php` the user should be taken to `http(s)://home/simon/html/wordpress/wp-config.php` when trying to download the file). This change is on lines 246-253 of `includes/class-wc-download-handler.php`.\n\n2. For absolute URLs to the current site (e.g. `http://localhost/wordpress/wp-config.php`) we've implemented filetype checking just like if the user had input a path.
