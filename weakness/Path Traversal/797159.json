The IBB requires that all in-scope open source projects be mutually engaged with us to ensure there is a good experience for all. Unfortunately, we have not been able to maintain that relationship with the upstream PHP community, and as a result, HackerOne and the IBB Panel have collectively agreed to shut down the program indefinitely.\n\nIn an effort to reward researchers for their hard work and patience thus far, the IBB panel has elected to pay bounties to all valid reports without PHP’s input. Bounty amounts are decided on based on the PHP policy and severity assigned on the accompanying CVE. \n\nAs an act of good faith, we will also close this report as Resolved.\n\nThank you for helping keep the internet safe and secure!\n-The Internet Bug Bounty Panel \n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-10T00:40:32.048Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T00:40:32.048Z","actor":{"username":"reed","cleared":false,"url":"/reed","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/132/66d7eadcea16b878bb67bfd697b9542250a801a7_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"vorismi3","url":"/vorismi3"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9478690,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-10T01:47:28.426Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T01:47:28.426Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"reed","cleared":false,"url":"/reed","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/132/66d7eadcea16b878bb67bfd697b9542250a801a7_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9762796,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-11-09T01:47:33.257Z","updated_at":"2020-11-09T01:47:33.257Z","actor":{"url":"/ibb","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/variants/v0qywgoh5hm4cbhuanu8mqdtowhr/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22ibb%20revision%205%20copy.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ibb%2520revision%25205%2520copy.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQSWVBQGJF%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T152903Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIDKFbNpVUzrOPbUQYjhN4DgAxVU5%2FXEKmVfjCMWb%2BNkIAiABDuahSBdMUCytEahxX048K6jzH7PGdOzEr8bjHNv10CqDBAjv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMFF93LkCZvrkmcBNoKtcDT4JSiF4LJ9dMlVWVXz6ozMkun%2BZIV%2FnNB6qVpNI4VDOdAc06QNZffMvjZwfupMjaAHpuIYcvqlkda6prO9SWrglyS6NCrBHv2gaT40jgHA6ufjwtH7OxGYsx039h%2Bh8lmcb39NUtDqetz1GDVn0P%2BUNi77DW4gUN5GnzWQsten34H99dGqb8t6pYxCQN%2F8DKWHJ%2BalzRH5DiTjmpYvgNaPu2xwo%2F6Zr8S4tdff1lzr%2BcSt%2FZceeJJnqd2Z9QEAJO7SqjLAnxMOiEuHPHYVOEZ3kfA%2B%2Bbt34tKfFC8MGX%2BXh1zYwal1wOrSP2k%2FZSlC9lsLebNN7Iooim1lSpjw7Du5GV89O7g%2F7rGROCUF%2B%2BB24LrVSbZTIggbHns1VxsRvSvZGmJHi7XvmhECvDwu9WmRNJs7XWIMzDD0fOHc22lsbafqmlkdZqwRzJhStehJfZCskFpe6v4wdnRFJqrnSW1n3s9Cn28vHMBxxweBr72n7tIeDBX4PMTrrfy%2B5OhLDCrxYOtKZndzmZHfMzTm0b0uMHvqjv6rofYcR42du%2BPYJ87HhllMZGstEyOaYDwXJ6mUAWqgFU1cRtr5KgJU%2BjBFYZrWtE%2BoZkvuXgEXg40jlw%2BeRQEreWMOGKkYsGOqYBYdUdmtOC7YWorffY3XWIt13STuNB47ZWJ85D8q%2F8hMPTVw3x9BFRZcvFy7ieSMolt4GYUK%2F8moEzkTt%2FanjYuLBUJFMJFunxOEvaMPJA128lGEkS1qX60D7%2BiOofrwvOesADqaqm%2FmYvf6HgURng7sqkiLxzy3mjSpM33Soz6mVH2tmMNYspiP4BF%2BNbXdXLCjYBsB98ENZjOy3b4d4U9P8NkvkUag%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=1246dc8aec97981133d240add7e5d1d24460602dfb8b77cd5f117a9fe35e71e9"},"profile":{"name":"Internet Bug Bounty"}},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
