discovered that LINE Keep(a file storage service in the LINE App) contains an unsafe unzipping pattern, which can potentially be exploited to launch Path traversal attack.

If not, pull to refresh. At this point, the PoC application tries to replace the original Memo file with a malicious ZIP file which contains an entry containing path traversal characters (“../”) in its name (e.g. `../../../../../../../data/data/jp.naver.line.android/files/something`)\n\nTap your ZIP note and tap on it again to open the contents of the ZIP file\n\nThe LINE app will crash as part of a \"SecurityException,\" but at this point, the files in the LINE app's private folders have already been overwritten.","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false,"attachments":[],"user":{"id":792437,"username":"lee-by","name":"ByoungYunLee","bio":"","cleared":false,"website":null,"location":"","created_at":"2019-10-23T02:30:19.864Z","url":"https://hackerone.com/lee-by","anc_triager":false,"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null,"user_type":"hacker","profile_picture_urls":{"small":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/e7YSYHJbCxRkTMx3w2a92mts/43e4513b9104ea0d68c9c096cea374ba8440dde3e027af5465c8771e8839a67c","medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/e7YSYHJbCxRkTMx3w2a92mts/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c","xtralarge":"https://hackerone.com/rails/active_storage/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBOTkyRWc9PSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6d562b02eb851e1e0a8edd205797dcb1503654d5/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdCam9MY21WemFYcGxTU0lOTWpZd2VESTJNRDRHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6InZhcmlhdGlvbiJ9fQ==--7e37b612eb3c91a96f98ad01ca9fbe53cab870dd/avatar.png"}}},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
