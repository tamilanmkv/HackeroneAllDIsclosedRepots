An attacker exploiting this vulnerability can identify a user when they visit a malicious website.\n\n## Description\n**Threat model:** The attacker knows the victim’s Twitter ID/username and aims at identifying them when visiting one of the controlled websites such as a blog or a news website. Another goal that the attacker could wish to achieve is to identify a user out of a group of potential target users. \n\n**Vulnerability**\nI found out that a user-related content is being loaded when visiting the developer tools and that is https://developer.twitter.com/api/users/USER_ID/client-applications.json. If the USER_ID is different from the ID of a currently logged in user the error 403 will be returned with the following JSON output\n```json\n{\"error\":{\"message\":\"You are not logged in as a user that has access to this developer.twitter.com resource.\",\"sent\":\"2019-03-06T01:20:56+00:00\",\"transactionId\":\"00d08f800009d7be\"}}. \n```\nOtherwise, a list of created apps will be displayed (the list will be empty if the user didn't create any app) and no error will be thrown.\n\nIt is possible to detect whether the file returned an error or not by a simple onload/onerror event handlers. The example code is shown in [#Steps-to-reproduce](#Steps-to-reproduce)\n\n\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Visit any website\n2. Execute the following javascript code while replacing `Your ID` with an ID you want to test for\n\n```javascript\nvar id = 'Your ID'\nvar script = document.createElement('script');\nscript.src = `https://developer.twitter.com/api/users/${id}/client-applications.json`;\n\nscript.onload = () =\u003e console.log('ID match');\nscript.onerror = e =\u003e console.log('ID mismatch');\ndocument.head.appendChild(script);\n```\n\nThese steps have been implemented in the Proof of Concept: https://terjanq.github.io/Bug-Bounty/Twitter/confirming-username/poc.html\n\nPoC in action: https://youtu.be/_S_ImYPvvhc\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can expose the identity of Twitter users when they visit a prepared for that purpose website.","bounty_amount":"1470.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,470","weakness":{"id":46,"name":"Privacy Violation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-05-28T19:47:14.965Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-74892006.28884502,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":146,"voters":["j_m","stargravy","foobar7","base_64","sameerphad72","mik317","dhakal_ananda","ali","terjanq","florisvdk","and 136 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":5.7,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":1062,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.twitter.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4278314,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you for your report @terjanq.\n\nWe were able to reproduce the behavior that you described and will respond when we have more information.\n\nThank you for thinking of Twitter security.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-03-07T20:06:07.668Z","updated_at":"2019-03-07T20:06:17.384Z","actor":{"username":"bugtriage-alex","cleared":false,"url":"/bugtriage-alex","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"twitter","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":4325889,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thank you for your report.
