This vulnerability allows, even `Guest` role users to create new test cases.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.  Consider a private project with `Guest` role user.\n2.  Consider the API for creating an `issue`.\n\n      The URL is https://gitlab.com/project_name/-/issues (POST).\n\n    POST Data format for this is as follows: \n    ```\n    utf8=âœ“\nauthenticity_token= your_auth_token\nissue[title]=issue_title\nissue[description]=issue_description\nissue[confidential]=0\nissue[issue_type]=issue\nissue[lock_version]=0\n```\n3. Now, in the parameter_set,  tamper with `issue[issue_type]` value and change it from `issue` to `test_case`.\n4. Now, send the request.\n5. A test case is now created. \n\nThe test case can be viewed at https://gitlab.com/project_name/-/quality/test_cases\n\n## Impact\n\nTest Cases are important part of a project  as it helps product, quality and development teams to combine and Guest users should not be allowed to create it.","bounty_amount":"650.0","formatted_bounty":"$650","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege Escalation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":49,"voters":["yssk","l3vy_ke","run_win","ali","xsky","exbrazily","sodium_","not_khun_myat","akashhamal0x01","lanhk","and 39 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":4.3,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":18138,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"gitlab.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":10831013,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @maruthi12,\n\nThank you for submitting this report!

So, they will be able to see both the buttons.\nNow, when the user clicks \"Post as Admin\" , it throws 401 not Authorized.\n\nSuppose, user tampers with the post API and changes \"admin\" as true, then he was able to create an admin post.\nBut here he did not create with  \"Post as Admin\" nor the API and hence the bypass.\n\nI believe this is a similar case here. User - Guest and Admin - other roles. I am able to bypass the existing functionaility as mentioned in the docs which is not intended by the application.\n`\n\u003e Proof that the Guest user can create Test Cases naturally:\n\n\u003e Since the  \"Post as Admin\" is exposed in the frontend, does it mean that a User can actually post as admin? - No.\nThe frontend if-else check is simply missing.\n\nLet me know if this helps resolve your understanding.\n\nThanks and Regards,\nMaruthi Adithya","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-03-01T12:41:07.791Z","updated_at":"2021-03-01T12:41:07.791Z","actor":{"username":"maruthi12","cleared":false,"url":"/maruthi12","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10846404,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @rchan @gitlab_cmaxim\n\nI would really like one of the Gitlab team members to take a look at this issue.\n\nThe triage team member claims that it is a UI glitch. I had referenced Gitlab's documentation and permissions page clearly for reference here.\n\nLike, even if it is what he claims it to be which I am pretty sure its not, I would really like your team's opinion on it.\n\nAccording to me, for all the privilege  escalation bugs, the UI/ Frontend does not matter as one can directly reproduce these bugs with the help of APIs. And suppose if the feature is working as expected, then both the permission docs and the feature description documentation must be updated as it is hard of researchers to know what is the scope of a particular user role.\n\nAs it stands: Guests cannot create test cases in the project. And the GraphQL API returns a \"Permission Denied\" for this action.\n\nAwaiting your response and thoughts on this.\n\nThanks and Regards,\nMaruthi Adithya","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-03-02T01:59:10.843Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T01:59:10.843Z","actor":{"username":"maruthi12","cleared":false,"url":"/maruthi12","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10846674,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @maruthi12,\n\nWe will have a discussion about this, and we'll let you know after having the discussion with our engineering team.\n\nThanks,\nRon","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-03-02T02:33:42.662Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T02:33:42.662Z","actor":{"username":"rchan","cleared":false,"url":"/rchan","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10857115,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugReopened","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-03-02T20:30:40.153Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T20:30:40.153Z","actor":{"username":"rchan","cleared":false,"url":"/rchan","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10857120,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":null,"automated_response":false,"created_at":"2021-03-02T20:31:24.451Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T20:31:24.451Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Medium","new_severity":"Low","old_severity_id":997783,"new_severity_id":999996},"actor":{"username":"rchan","cleared":false,"url":"/rchan","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":10857121,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Hello @maruthi12,\n\nThank you for submitting this report.\n\nWe have verified this finding and have escalated to our engineering team.
