The original report seems to have been closed as informative. Although I have no way to reliably verify this, I can see in my reputation log that I got zero increase for this report, which is exactly what happens when a report gets closed as duplicate of an informative.\n\nAnd that's what I don't understand. This bug is definitely severe enough to not be closed as informative. I mean, using this bug the attacker can delete all Instacart lists, or replace all list images with something very unappetizing. Although I could imagine some other website not caring about this, I know that you care, because I submitted a similar report #162822 and it was accepted, even though it was less severe.\n\nAlso, judging by the Hackerone identifier, the original report was submitted on August 15th, which was 2 months ago. And after 2 months the vulnerability is still there. I find it hard to believe that you would knowingly keep a vulnerable endpoint in production for 2 months in a feature that is not even public yet.\n\nOf course I wouldn't need to hypothesize if you invited me to the original report and thus gave me opportunity to understand the situation and defend my point of view.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-10-14T18:30:18.177Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T18:30:18.177Z","actor":{"username":"sameoldstory","cleared":false,"url":"/sameoldstory","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/096/923/44c14c32450369140f1d9943753d37475ae8884c_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"instacart","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1248120,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@sameoldstory I added you to the previous report.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-10-14T18:50:59.705Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T18:50:59.705Z","actor":{"username":"cxmcc-instacart","cleared":false,"url":"/cxmcc-instacart","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"instacart","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1248139,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Could you please reread my report?\n\nFrom the comments to the report you added me to:\n\u003e this doesn't seem to allow you to actually change another user's list\n\nThe bug I reported does allow you to actually change another user's list.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-10-14T19:09:54.812Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T19:09:54.812Z","actor":{"username":"sameoldstory","cleared":false,"url":"/sameoldstory","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/096/923/44c14c32450369140f1d9943753d37475ae8884c_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"instacart","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1248179,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Also please let me know if there was something particular in my report that made you think that I'm not able to actually change other user's lists, so that I can avoid misunderstandings like this in the future.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-10-14T19:30:56.157Z","updated_at":"2016-10-14T19:30:56.157Z","actor":{"username":"sameoldstory","cleared":false,"url":"/sameoldstory","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/096/923/44c14c32450369140f1d9943753d37475ae8884c_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"instacart","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1248478,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@sameoldstory I am able to reproduce this.
