An attacker can delete these public keys used by other users to deploy code.\n\n# Impact\nDeleting these shared deploy keys may stop users to deploy their code.\n\n# Proof of concept\nMake sure the GitLab instance has a public deploy key. Lets assume it has ID 1. Now sign in as a normal user and follow the steps below.\n\n1. Create a new project called `test`\n2. Go to http://gitlab-instance/user/test/deploy_keys\n3. Go to the `Public deploy keys available to any project` section and click the `Enable` button for the public deploy key\n4. Create an access token for the API for your own account\n5. Request `/api/v3/projects`, get the ID number for the project `test`\n6. Request `/api/v3/projects/:project_id/deploy_keys`, you'll see the public deploy key\n7. Send a `DELETE` request to `/api/v3/projects/:project_id/deploy_keys/:id - this will delete the public (shared) deploy key, not the relationship between the project and the key. Below is a copy of the request and response.\n\n**Request**\n```\ncurl -X DELETE -H \"Private-Token: AAAA\" http://gitlab-instance/api/v3/projects/1/deploy_keys/1\n```\n\n\n**Response**\n```\n{\"id\":1,\"user_id\":null,\"created_at\":\"\u003cremoved\u003e\",\"updated_at\":\"\u003cremoved\u003e\",\"key\":\"\u003ckey\u003e\",\"title\":\"\u003ctitle\u003e\",\"fingerprint\":\"72:bb:e9:cc:04:dc:64:b9:a3:e7:c2:26:8f:f2:ed:df\",\"public\":true}\n```\n\nThe root cause of this problem lies in the following lines of code:\n\n**lib/api/deploy_keys.rb**\n```ruby\ndelete \":id/#{path}/:key_id\" do\n  key = user_project.deploy_keys.find(params[:key_id])\n  key.destroy\nend\n```\n\nThe `destroy` method will be called on the shared deploy key instead of on the relationship.\n\n# Remediation advice\nInstead of removing the entire object, remove the relationship instead when it's a public deploy key.","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege Escalation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-02-22T20:47:24.312Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-146164298.9690914,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":12,"voters":["derision","bogdantcaciuc","ayoubfathi_","mpz","eveeez","kieran","japz","spetr0x","cryptosector","arice","and 2 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":6.5,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"none","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1393768,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks Jobert!\n\nI've opened confidential issue https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/26243 and will keep you updated on our progress.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-01-01T18:45:54.238Z","updated_at":"2017-01-01T18:45:54.238Z","actor":{"username":"briann","cleared":false,"url":"/briann","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1437145,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"A patch for this vulnerability is scheduled to go out in a security release tomorrow.
