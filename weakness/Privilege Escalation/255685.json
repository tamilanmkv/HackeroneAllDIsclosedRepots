For example, simply navigating directly to the setup page (https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/{{ACC#}}/integrations/accounts/wizard/1/step/1) allows the restricted user to add their own AWS account. So, I followed along the instructions with my restricted account within AWS, attached the account, and was able to add the integration:\n\n{F209130}\n\nNice! Looks like I don't need to be an admin after all. \n\n##Steps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Create a NR account\n1. Add a user to the account with a Base Role of restricted, they should have Read Only access to Infrastructure.\n1. Login as the Restricted User, navigate to https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/integrations/accounts/wizard/1/step to find out what Account ID and External ID needs to be used. Then once you have that info, navigate to https://infrastructure.newrelic.com/accounts/1523936/integrations/accounts/wizard/1/step/1 to enter the ARN code and connect your AWS account. \n1. Click Next, the connection will be made (if you've done the AWS setup correctly), and you've successfully elevated your privileges as a Restricted user! \n\nLet me know if you have questions. \n\nJon Bottarini \n\n\n\n\n","bounty_amount":"750.0","formatted_bounty":"$750","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege
