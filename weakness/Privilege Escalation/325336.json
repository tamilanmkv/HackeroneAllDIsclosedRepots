ANYONE is able to own starbucks.com subdomain at the moment.\n\nThis vulnerability is called subdomain takeover. You can read more about it here:\n\n* https://blog.sweepatic.com/subdomain-takeover-principles/\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/32825\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/175070\n* https://hackerone.com/reports/172137\n\n### Details:\n\nsvcgatewayus.starbucks.com has CNAME to s00197tmp0crdfulprod0.trafficmanager.net which has CNAME to 1fd05821-7501-40de-9e44-17235e7ab48b.cloudapp.net. However, 1fd05821-7501-40de-9e44-17235e7ab48b.cloudapp.net is not registered in Azure cloud anymore and thus can be registered by anyone. After registering the Cloud App in Azure portal, the person doing so has full control over content on svcgatewayus.starbucks.com.\n\n### PoC:\n\nhttp://svcgatewayus.starbucks.com\n\n###Â Mitigation:\n\n* Remove the CNAME record from starbucks.com DNS zone completely.\n* Claim it back in Azure portal after I release it\n\nRegards,\n\nPatrik Hudak\n\n## Impact\n\nSubdomain takeover is abused for several purposes:\n\n* Malware distribution\n* Phishing / Spear phishing\n* XSS\n* Authentication bypass\n* ...\n\nList goes on and on.

You can create a new Cloud Service and choose the subdomain name which I matched with 1fd05821-7501-40de-9e44-17235e7ab48b.cloudapp.net.\n2. I created a Storage Account for the Cloud Service in Azure portal.\n3. Azure requires specific format for deployment of Cloud Services which is generated by Visual Studio. I created a simple ASP.NET web application and uploaded it to this Cloud Service (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-create-deploy-portal).\n4.
