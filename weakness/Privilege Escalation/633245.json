(They cannot really delete the whole received share, when they \"delete\" they are actually just \"unsharing\". But when they reshare on to `user2` then this \"implied delete\" is able to be passed on.\n\nThe problem also happens if user1 shares with a group, and adds the delete permission. Users in the group can delete files. user1 can share with a group that they are already a member of. That gives user1 delete access to the files in the folder.\n\n## Impact\n\nA malicious user can reshare any received share, adding the delete permission to the reshare. Thus giving themselves (if they are in the group) or the end-user the ability to delete files of the first user.\n\nThe scenario works with current server master.
