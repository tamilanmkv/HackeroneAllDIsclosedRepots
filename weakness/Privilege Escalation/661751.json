Using dig, I was able to determine that the subdomain 'd02-1-ag.productioncontroller.starbucks.com'   was vulnerable to takeover.  The record showed status: NXDOMAIN and was pointing to the CNAME: 3edbac0a-5c43-428a-b451-a5eb268f888b.cloudapp.net.\n2. Using this information, I was able to create a new Azure Cloud Service with the name '3edbac0a-5c43-428a-b451-a5eb268f888b'.  This would resolve to the CNAME record mentioned above.\n3. I then crafted a website and uploaded it to the cloud service using this as a guide: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-create-deploy-portal.\n4.

This would allow them to post malicious content which would be mistaken for a valid site.
