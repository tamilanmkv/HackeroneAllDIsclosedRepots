This is a high severity security issue because an attacker can register the subdomain on ███ and therefore can own the subdomain  █████████.\n\n\n\n#Description:\nThe dangling CNAME record of █████████  is pointing to █████.███████ which was not claimed by you. I registered a service with this name and therefore was able to takeover the subdomain. Every attacker doing this has afterwards full control over the contents served on this subdomain.\n\n\n\n#Subdomain Affected: \n██████████\n\n\n\n\n#Proof Of Concept:\nI have uploaded a simple subdomain takeover PoC on http://███████/████████\n\n\n\n\n\n# Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n1. Open ██████ and register for web app which is under market place. I have used ██████  (See: ████)\n\n2. After registering, go to Custom Domains which will be available under settings. (See: ████)\n\n3. In here, add custom domain i have used █████████ (See: █████)\n\n4. After that upload any PoC you want to upload. I have used ████ which has my PoC. (See: ███████)\n\n\n\n\n\n#Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n1. Remove the dangling CNAME record for █████\n\n2. Claim it back in ███████ portal after I release it\n\n#Reference\nSome hackerone reports #661751 #325336\n\n#NOTE:\nI have claimed the subdomain http://█████████ at the current moment to keep it safe from malicious users. Whenever you want i will release ██████.███. Afterwards you can claim it back.\n\n## Impact\n\nSubdomain takeover is abused for several purposes:\n\n1.\tMalware distribution\n2.\tPhishing / Spear phishing\n3.\tXSS","weakness":{"id":75,"name":"Privilege Escalation"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":5,"voters":["brumens","simplyrishabh","khizer47","gustavo2018","theblackmask"],"severity":{"rating":"critical","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8219732,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
