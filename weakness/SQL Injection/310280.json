There are tons of requests to remove this \"old\" technique.\n\nNevertheless I decided to report the issue, because similar code within the audited plugin is escaped - so this is more informational.\n\nLine 49-50:\n```\n$multi_layer_map_list = isset($_POST['multi_layer_map_list']) ? ($_POST['multi_layer_map_list']) : (isset($_GET['multi_layer_map_list']) ? ($_GET['multi_layer_map_list']) : '');\n$multi_layer_map_list_exploded = explode(',', $multi_layer_map_list);\n```\n\nAs you can see $_GET['multi_layer_map_list']/$_POST['multi_layer_map_list'] are not escaped and exploded by \",\" in line 50. \n\nThis may result in a succesful sql injection on line 145 - depending on the use case of the shortcode:\n```\n$mlm_query = \"SELECT \". $distance_query .\" l.id as lid,l.name as lname,... FROM `\" . $table_name_layers . \"` as l INNER JOIN `\" . $table_name_markers . \"` AS m ON m.layer LIKE concat('%\\\"',l.id,'\\\"%') \". $search_query .\" WHERE l.id='\" . $multi_layer_map_list . \"'  ORDER BY ...\";\n```\nFix: esc_sql()\n\nA very similar behaviour can be found in line 149 and following:\n\n```\n$first_mlm_id = $multi_layer_map_list_exploded[0];\n$other_mlm_ids = array_slice($multi_layer_map_list_exploded,1);\n$mlm_query = \"(SELECT ... WHERE l.id='\" . $first_mlm_id . \"'  )\";\nforeach ($other_mlm_ids as $row) {\n    $mlm_query .= \" UNION (SELECT ... FROM `\" . $table_name_layers . \"` ... WHERE l.id='\" . $row . \"' )\";\n}\n```\n\nHere $row and $first_mlm_id are controlled by a guestuser and are not escaped or validated.\n\nFix: intval()\n\nThe only reason the application is not vulnerable is because of wp-settings.php:\n\n```\n// Add magic quotes and set up $_REQUEST ( $_GET + $_POST )\nwp_magic_quotes();\n```\n\nBut the problem is: a lot of themes and/or plugins (which are loaded sometimes before your plugin is loaded) reset this setting like described hiere:\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/8949768/with-magic-quotes-disabled-why-does-php-wordpress-continue-to-auto-escape-my\n\nI believe it may be a better solution to escaped mentioned parts, just to be sure!\n\nOfftopic: the plugin has also a lot of interesting backend functions and calls - are vulnerabilities which can be triggered by admin/mod/author relevent? I'm not talking about xss, more execs and sqlinjections.\n\n## Impact\n\nUnder certain circumstances a SQL Injection is possible.","bounty_amount":"10.0","formatted_bounty":"$10","weakness":{"id":67,"name":"SQL Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-06-17T08:27:10.273Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-104739334.66923518,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":14,"voters":["damian89","prob0x01","eveeez","an0nym0us","apapedulimu","japz","cryptographer","kass198","sahilharchandani22","pseudononomys_anonymous","and 4 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":356,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"Maps Marker Pro WordPress plugin","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2328412,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugResolved","message":"Thanks for your report, seems like we missed adding esc_sql() and intval() on the lines you pointed out.
