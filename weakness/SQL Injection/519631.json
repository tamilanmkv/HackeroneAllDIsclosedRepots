With the Network tab of devtools open, visit https://██████/████/recruiter/updapp.aspx\n3. Replay the GET request that returned the HTTP 500 error as a POST request with the body `app_id='`. This can be done by right clicking on the request, copying it as cURL, pasting the command in terminal, and appending ` -k -X POST --data \"app_id='\"`.\n4. Notice in the response, there is an error: `ORA-01756: quoted string not properly terminated`. This is because the single apostrophe (`'`) caused the SQL query to be syntactically invalid.\n5. Replay the request in the same way as shown in #3, but with the body `app_id=''` (this time append ` -k -X POST --data \"app_id=''\"` to the cURL command). \n6. Notice in the response, there is an error: `ORA-01722: invalid number`. This is because the double apostrophes (`''`)  did not cause the SQL query to be syntactically invalid, but because aposrophes are not numbers, they caused a different error.\n7.
