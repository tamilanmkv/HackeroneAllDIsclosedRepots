Visit the vulnerable url (https://███/██████/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true\u0026_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_61) while using an intercepting proxy\n2. Intercept GET request to capture full URL and all form parameters\n3. Utilize sqlmap to detect and exploit sql injection in \"MSI_additionalFilterType1\" parameter\n\nNote: The default configuration of sqlmap will not be able to find the sql injection. I adjusted the following parameters in order to do so.  \"--risk 2 --level 3\" and \"--tamper=space2comment,randomcase,between\"\n\n\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\n\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\n1. Sanitize all form parameter inputs, and use whitelisting to allow only needed data\n2. Rate limit submissions of forms. Time based sql injection requires many more HTTP requests than would be seen from legitimate browser activity.\n\n## Impact\n\nHigh/Critical impact.\n\nThis sql injection attack could be used to retrieve all information from the database. Also, the account is running with DBA privileges which would allow for the retrieval of database account passwords and takeover of the server itself via injection of system commands; these could be leveraged to attack other systems on the network and potential lateral movement to other systems.","weakness":{"id":67,"name":"SQL Injection"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":2,"voters":["m0chan","sl33pyp0t4t0"],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":5780203,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
