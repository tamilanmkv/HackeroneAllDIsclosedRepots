With SSRF it’s also possible to access services from the same server that is listening on the loopback interface.\nUsing Server Side Request Forgery attacks it’s possible to:\n\n+ Scan and attack systems from the internal network that are not normally accessible\n+ Enumerate and attack services that are running on these hosts\n+ Exploit host-based authentication services\n\n##Steps to reproduce##\n\n+ Navigate to https://apps.nextcloud.com/developer/apps/releases/new\n+ Enter https://127.0.0.1:22 (SSH) or https://127.0.0.1:80 (HTTP) (Download Link area) \n+ You will get this error\n{F168743}\n         means the 22 port is opened, the same with 80\n+ but if you entered https://127.0.0.1:21 (Telnet) you will get this error \n{F168742}\n         means the 21 port isn't opened\n\n***Thanks.***\n","weakness":{"id":68,"name":"Server-Side Request Forgery
