Here, adding the required information: \n\n##Title: Server-Side Request Forgery in \"icons.bitwarden.net\".\n##URL: https://icons.bitwarden.net/spoofed.burpcollaborator.net/icon.png\n##Parameter: REST based in \"https://icons.bitwarden.net/{DOMAIN-HERE}/icon.png\"\n##Summary: The application failed to validate the vulnerable URL which led to internal port scanning through SSRF vulnerability. \n##Severity: High\n\n##Proof of Concept: \n1. The application shows \"https://icons.bitwarden.net/localhost/icon.png\". - 400 Bad Request.\n2. The application shows https://icons.bitwarden.net/spoofed.burpcollaborator.net/icon.png - 404 Not Found.\nNote: Furthermore, an attacker would be able to perform host discovery and internal port scanning which I did not perform as the scope was not mentioned in the list so better that you can proceed with the above Proof of Concept steps. \n\n##Recommendation:\nIn the above steps, localhost was restricted but was able to bypass using domain \"spoofed.burpcollaborator.net\" which resolves \"127.0.0.1\". The application should resolve the domain and restrict access to internal resources.\n\n## Impact\n\n* An attacker would be able to perform SSRF attack to retrieve internal infrastructure information.","weakness":{"id":68,"name":"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-08-07T14:39:00.820Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-37155750.39844555,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":11,"voters":["jatindhankhar","ali","sudi","za_sec","sa1tama0","iamcoolcat","pmsecurise","v13rsba","shravs05","namami","and 1 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":767,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"bitwarden.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8472279,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-07-01T17:28:16.570Z","updated_at":"2020-07-01T17:28:16.570Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"High (7.5)","new_severity":"Medium","old_severity_id":767369,"new_severity_id":767379},"actor":{"username":"kspearrin","cleared":false,"url":"/kspearrin","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/NfF9KdzShJTHMmhSb4ajYq1p/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"bitwarden","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":8472287,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Thanks for the report.
