In this case, the issue affects anywhere where HTML can be added.\n\n# Why does this vulnerability exist?\n---\n\nBy creating a link with `https://gitlab.com@example.com` the parser ignores it and does not add the usual `rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"` which is located on all other links. I discovered this, because I noticed that internal links are treated differently than external links. So in the example above the victim ends up on `example.com`, which is where the same scenario as https://hackerone.com/reports/211065 can be performed.\n\nIn order to demonstrate this issue the following payload can be used:\n\n~~~\n\u003ca href=\"https://gitlab.com@example.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eReverse Tabnabbing\u003c/a\u003e\n~~~\n\n# Where does the issue lie?\n---\n\nThe issue appears to lie in the following lines of code:\n\n~~~\nit 'skips internal links' do\n    internal = Gitlab.config.gitlab.url\n    exp = act = %Q(\u003ca href=\"#{internal}/sign_in\"\u003eLogin\u003c/a\u003e)\n    expect(filter(act).to_html).to eq exp\n  end\n~~~\n\nLink to source code: https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/spec/lib/banzai/filter/external_link_filter_spec.rb#L16-L20\n\nIf you require further information feel free to contact me.\n\nYours sincerely,\nEd","weakness":{"id":74,"name":"UI Redressing (Clickjacking)"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-06-08T16:34:05.768Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-137021421.3049768,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":8,"voters":["ysx","eveeez","ak1t4","japz","hacklad","spetr0x","kkp_hackk9","rcowsill"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":5.4,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"low","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1534761,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Sorry I just noticed that the issue does not actually lie in https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/spec/lib/banzai/filter/external_link_filter_spec.rb#L16-L20, since those are the tests you perform.\n\nThe issue appears to lie here: \n\n~~~\ndef external_url?(url)\n   !url.start_with?(internal_url)\nend\n~~~\n\nLink to source code: https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitlabhq/blob/master/lib/banzai/filter/external_link_filter.rb#L39-L41","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-03-11T18:50:01.298Z","updated_at":"2017-03-11T18:55:27.734Z","actor":{"username":"edoverflow","cleared":true,"url":"/edoverflow","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/116/374/9a3cf4d62b2f507a0d33808aacbad863ec4455ac_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1535799,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Hi @edio,\n\nYou're right that internal URLs aren't having `noopener noreferrer` etc. included.

The result of the missing `target=_blank` means that this is treated like any other link in a web page and browsers will not maintain a reference back to the referring document.\n\nThis is interesting stuff though.
