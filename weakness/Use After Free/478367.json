core bug: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=77269\n\nThis bugfix actually involves two vulnerabilities: a call to efree on uninitialized data and another free()  based vulnerability. What is described below is a bug that was fixed in libgd two years ago (CVE-2016-10166), but the patch was never applied to PHP's libgd. Furthermore, the patch for that CVE introduced a use after free vulnerability, also in PHPs `imagescale()` function. This can be seen in the comment history of the PHP bug.\n\n----\nThe bug occurs in ext/gd/libgd/gd_interpolation.c in the function _gdContributionsAlloc(int line_size, int windows_size). The function will attempt to allocate helper structs and receives two parameters: the line size and the windows size. To prevent integer overflows, each parameter is passed to gd's overflow2() function before being used in the gdMalloc function.\n(gdMalloc is just #define gdMalloc emalloc).\n\nHowever, if the overflow2 check for windows size is positive, overflow_error is set to true, which leads to gd attempting to free all the lines allocated so far. The issue is that gd does not check if any lines have been allocated so far at all. By supplying input that leads to overflow2 being true, .Weights is freed, which is an unintialized pointer. \n\n```\nif (overflow2(line_length, sizeof(ContributionType))) {\n\t\tgdFree(res);\n\t\treturn NULL;\n\t}\n\tres-\u003eContribRow = (ContributionType *) gdMalloc(line_length * sizeof(ContributionType));\n\tif (res-\u003eContribRow == NULL) {\n\t\tgdFree(res);\n\t\treturn NULL;\n\t}\n\tfor (u = 0 ; u \u003c line_length ; u++) {\n\t\tif (overflow2(windows_size, sizeof(double))) {\n\t\t\toverflow_error = 1;\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\tres-\u003eContribRow[u].Weights = (double *) gdMalloc(windows_size * sizeof(double));\n\t\t}\n\t\tif (overflow_error == 1 || res-\u003eContribRow[u].Weights == NULL) {\n\t\t\tunsigned int i;\n\t\t\tu--;\n\t\t\tfor (i=0;i\u003c=u;i++) {\n                gdFree(res-\u003eContribRow[i].Weights);\n\t\t\t}\n```\n\nWhen the for loop is reached that frees the uninitialized pointers, i will be 0 and u too. However, before the for loop is entered u is decremented by one so it will turn into -1 , which leads to the condition i \u003c=0 never being met.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis vulnerability can be used to write a local safe mode bypass and can potentially be exploited remotely.","bounty_amount":"1500.0","formatted_bounty":"$1,500","weakness":{"id":50,"name":"Use After Free"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2020-11-09T01:47:20.687Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-29078212.724395934,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":16,"voters":["simonscannell","mik317","demonia","mosasalman","coredumped7893","mrblu","23nitro","morpheusau","moru_2020","napalmnes_","and 6 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"critical","score":9.8,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"none","user_interaction":"none","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"high","integrity":"high","availability":"high"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":84120,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"PHP","max_severity":"none"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4002596,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hey @simonscannell - Thanks for the submission.

The IBB requires that all in-scope open source projects be mutually engaged with us to ensure there is a good experience for all. Unfortunately, we have not been able to maintain that relationship with the upstream PHP community, and as a result, HackerOne and the IBB Panel have collectively agreed to shut down the program indefinitely.\n\nIn an effort to reward researchers for their hard work and patience thus far, the IBB panel has elected to pay bounties to all valid reports without PHP’s input. Bounty amounts are decided on based on the PHP policy and severity assigned on the accompanying CVE. \n\nAs an act of good faith, we will also close this report as Resolved.\n\nThank you for helping keep the internet safe and secure!\n-The Internet Bug Bounty Panel \n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-10T00:41:04.744Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T00:41:04.744Z","actor":{"username":"reed","cleared":false,"url":"/reed","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/132/66d7eadcea16b878bb67bfd697b9542250a801a7_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"reporter":{"username":"simonscannell","url":"/simonscannell"},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9478689,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-10T01:47:20.608Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T01:47:20.608Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"reed","cleared":false,"url":"/reed","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/003/132/66d7eadcea16b878bb67bfd697b9542250a801a7_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9479666,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thank you so much!\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-10T08:14:23.508Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T08:14:23.508Z","actor":{"username":"simonscannell","cleared":false,"url":"/simonscannell","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/HvE5FGgP56eXFMNMr4rwmunu/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9479667,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-10T08:14:32.158Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T08:14:32.158Z","actor":{"username":"simonscannell","cleared":false,"url":"/simonscannell","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/HvE5FGgP56eXFMNMr4rwmunu/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":9479668,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-10-10T08:14:32.217Z","updated_at":"2020-10-10T08:14:32.217Z","actor":{"username":"simonscannell","cleared":false,"url":"/simonscannell","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/HvE5FGgP56eXFMNMr4rwmunu/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"ibb","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
