These credentials are related to Vagrant  tool which is used to setup virtual machines environment, This is a very critical disclosure and can lead to bigger damages. So I am informing this to you guys, please let me know what do you guys think.\n\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\nVISIT THESE LINKS\nRepository :  kubernetes /kubernetes \nCommit Link : https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/commit/5a0159ea00e082bc85bbec18d1ab7ae78d90fa4f\nRepository Link : https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/5a0159ea00e082bc85bbec18d1ab7ae78d90fa4f/cluster/kubecfg.sh\n\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\nReference:\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/124100\n\n## Impact\n\nVagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. This can give hacker access to the hacker to the automation tool to setup VMs and their environment, which he can use for further escalation.","weakness":{"id":64,"name":"Use of Hard-coded Credentials"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":833376,"file_name":"kub-cred1.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1hEKeme9nEHpdRQcn6NNfjQJ?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22kub-cred1.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27kub-cred1.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ57JDOB6N%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T153708Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHcaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJGMEQCIEj%2FvPHmMbBPYj%2BEqI%2BytJ5vP%2BW1Gij3b1KCROLW2m2fAiAUI2BnkECXV9d7hwkeZDEOYP6soFW%2FVQ7MIgaTaOghmSqDBAjw%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAIaDDAxMzYxOTI3NDg0OSIMaJpXtlkzQ%2F0YHokTKtcDqr54hfj92oRcu2Uf5AYn5X1dcYZ2fUSGzbf8TlAKPi%2BieszVvrvHI%2FlmbHmgiT1EynvsarNndOfkF2FRqu00jKx0CkmuRzepTozsI%2FVM4zmVsulVco0%2FTcUTH7ncLq5w17UCDOGpnW6JGeAot2EMSfGI%2BXeXow9Po2gINOm1gQnayfBCxU0Glim8HMTLVSft15PsLBhoVz6MQjjs5LpN9XS8yUG%2FvTzXTgclJY%2F9kWPo7VUzvyGgDBwaQ1NS4mY%2FwZ0AT%2BbZ6JXbFSX9ET%2BsjMi2Xi4Iz%2BSZK9IqUkrM05KykgVZmm0Jj83i2n43f%2BohD1oputpWW5Uu1cAXNs%2F4CRB2hvvyPQb%2B2khSXC6sOQi3exb9EuT5FkfOJXRD2w2ObGvWHxM%2BDQNczFHMaUBsCSSNn2cKqA093ghnjQ0g83xgTV9SBPb0QjpItD1Tnt9%2Bri%2FBh8RNCTedm%2Bor7TU6AnBCa6N50D96ANJhWhGw8kKZQdvzW0b0yw%2FH0clJ9XBtHGp1ul88rpA7tUuIoM7z31gr%2FReHR4G0fbpI0Bw%2BzUst%2BenEZyU7QQChxDc0u9loqAHNkWSJ3vDfDAhU2gFvocid02DAX%2FlKRXns4oUAYN7obhQgZX31MK2XkYsGOqYBmhNgLXdsx%2F8OPaK%2FmcpHbqK%2FVdgD3s09C%2FMBcjoeNruPiR%2B0%2FIpdgtcxNhaPoR0zb6re%2ByXh4v3hr2D2Z0%2BZCE4KiobLnf4PqE9a5czy2i5ctMeGIPCspubSRwCRBRORrnkT6%2FEocUc5PNqombEgctkvB80CoCyMfXpFqtIL0ne7x%2B%2B6lVkpXfm14Eb3XaRg7qWG7XL4Ud5U62KMTzbzA3t%2FxnvzsA%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=37b5925b2cb5833bffc7c9137c53317c8385b77c83b02b05df9a29c5cfa60fdd","file_size":49367,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":0,"voters":[],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":32459,"asset_type":"SOURCE_CODE","asset_identifier":"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":8044891,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @cyberhawksec,\n\nThank you for your submission.
