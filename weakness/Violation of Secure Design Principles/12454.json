If such a condition is recognized, the injected code is changed in a way, that it is not executed anymore to prevent a succesful XSS attack. The downside of these filters is, that the browser has no possibility to distinguish between code fragments which were reflected by a vulnerable web application in an XSS attack and these which are already present on the page. In the past, these filters were used by attackers to deactivate JavaScript code on the attacked web page. Sometimes the XSS filters itself are vulnerable in a way, that web applications which were protected properly against XSS attacks became vulnerable under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nRemediation background :-\r\nIt is considered as better practice to instruct the browser XSS filter to never render the web page if an XSS attack is detected.","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2014-11-27T16:28:30.431Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-216853552.81606227,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":1,"voters":["sw33tlie"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":54268,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"I'll look into this and see if I can set this header.
