No well-known attack seems to be usable against their infrastructure, and the \"cipher strength\" score is not bad. But nothing about Logjam.\n- KeyCDN: Heroku is no more impacted by Logjam, according to [this tool](https://tools.keycdn.com/logjam).\n\nYou recommend us to remove the ciphers based on 3DES ([which are still present in the Intermediate compatibility cipher list suggested by mozilla](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS)) but the link you gave us says nothing about it. Can you provide us more details about why you think this is an real issue?\n\nThe only way to make our SSL ~~great again~~ better would be to follow [the same process that whit537 did](https://github.com/gratipay/security-2a443f/issues/1) ([even if it seems to be automatic now](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/816)), but I don't think it's worth. \n\nFurthermore, concerning SSH, I have strong reasons to believe these ciphers could not be considered as \"weak\". Your report references an old CVE for one OpenSSH version which is not currently in use. I found [a publication](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/SandPfinal.pdf) which seems related with what you said. However, I can't find any strong argument proving that the current implementation of CBC ciphers inside our version in use of OpenSSH is *really* unsafe. \n\nI'm suggesting to close this report as \"Informative\".\n\nTL;DR: For SSL and SSH ciphers, I don't think we have control over it and it's not worth to try.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-14T11:53:41.959Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T11:54:04.320Z","actor":{"username":"nashe_","cleared":false,"url":"/nashe_","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1068665,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\u003e the quality of Heroku's SSL/TLS\n\nI made this same mistake ... we're talking about `grtp.co` here (Digital Ocean), not `gratipay.com` (Heroku). :o)","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-14T12:12:53.165Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T12:12:53.165Z","actor":{"username":"whit537","cleared":false,"url":"/whit537","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/034/094/b38b9225fd8592d05d5e6939116e8f30d7c98af5_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1068668,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"Accepting as a theoretical risk, which carries a $1 bounty per [our program description](https://hackerone.com/gratipay).","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-07-14T12:13:58.675Z","updated_at":"2016-07-14T12:13:58.675Z","actor":{"url":"/gratipay","ibb":false,"profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/001/868/a75c6649c5b4671b3cf44160af884a7da9fd0b67_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"profile":{"name":"Gratipay"}},"bounty_amount":"1.0","bounty_currency":"usd","genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","collaborator":{"username":"mmyamin","url":"/mmyamin"},"actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1068736,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"God, that's right, sorry!
