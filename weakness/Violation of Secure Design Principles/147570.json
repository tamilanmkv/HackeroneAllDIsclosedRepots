missed something. \n```php\n$path = $request-\u003egetPathInfo();\n$path = rawurldecode($request-\u003egetPathInfo());\n if (substr($path, 0, 3) == '../' || substr($path, -3) == '/..' || strpos($path,

\"/\\..\" \u0026 \"\\/..\" this works because some oses (unix like) parse the backslash to forward slash and proceed. add those and I think you should be fine.

This doesn't work on base Unix, so it is a bit surprising that PHP would\naccept such a filename, but it appears that PHP is itself stripping off trailing slashes before opening the file. You can append any number of trailing slashes: /etc/passwd//// is also OK.\n\nAnd, you can append ./ (as many times as you want). For instance, /etc/passwd/., /etc/passwd/./, and /etc/passwd/././. all refer to /etc/passwd. \n\n**Fact 2**: Long paths are truncated. On most PHP installations, if the filename is longer than 4096 bytes, it will be silently truncated and everything after the first 4096 bytes will be discarded. No error is triggered: the excess characters are simply thrown away and PHP\nhappily continues on.\n\n**The attack.** Now I am ready to describe the attack. I'll show you the vulnerable code, why standard LFI attacks don't work, and then how to build a more-clever attack that does work.\n\nWith the additional background facts I gave you earlier, maybe you can see how to come up with a more sophisticated attack that defeats this limitation.\n\nBasically, the attacker chooses a very long parameter value, so that the constructed filename is longer than 4096 bytes long. When the filename is truncated, the .php extension will get thrown away. And if the attacker can arrange for the resulting filename to refer to an existing file on the filesystem, the attacker is good.\n\nNow this might sound like a far-fetched attack. What are the odds that we can find a filename on the filesystem whose full path happens to be exactly 4096 bytes long? Maybe not so good?\n\nThis is where the background facts come into play. The attacker can send a request with ?param1=../../../../etc/passwd/./././././\u003c...\u003e (with the ./ pattern repeated many thousands of times). Now look at what filename gets included, after the prefix is prepended and the\n.php file extension is added: it will be something like includes/../../../../etc/passwd/./././././\u003c...\u003e.php. This filename will be longer than 4096 bytes, so it will get truncated. The truncation will drop the file extension and leave us with a filename of the form includes/../../../../etc/passwd/./././././\u003c...\u003e. And, thanks to the way PHP handles trailing slashes and trailing ./ sequences, all that stuff at the end will be ignored. In other words, this filename will be treated by PHP as equivalent to the path\nincludes/../../../../etc/passwd. So PHP will try to read from the password file, and when it finds PHP syntax errors there, it may dump the contents of the password file into an error page -- disclosing\nsecret information to an attacker.\n\nSo this is indeed exploitable to include files \u0026 *isn't mitigated by the fact that only .php files can be included*\n\nThanks,\nP","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-06-27T11:06:25.101Z","updated_at":"2016-06-27T11:06:25.101Z","actor":{"username":"paulos_","cleared":false,"url":"/paulos_","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/008/601/abf2077609ef0546be8676abd1bec49aaefc9ff2_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"concretecms","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1041374,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Also
