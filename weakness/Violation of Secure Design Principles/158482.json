Unfortunately, it seems to be a duplicate of #157465. I'll ask you some questions to ensure that it's effectively the case:\n\n- Your example mention `GET https://gratipay.com/ HTTP/1.1`. It seems to be defined as the *absolute-form* in the [RFC7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.2) but it's not a common writing. Did you made a mistake here?\n- Since you need to craft this request and force the vicitm's browser to send it (SOP, etc), I don't see how you can \"poison browser DNS cache\" (I'll talk about this in the next point).\n- How is the DNS cache related to the attack you described? As far I know, Heroku uses the `Host` header to identify to which application route the request, so creating a fake Heroku application is not needed.\n- Did you found a functionality of gratipay.com which can be tricked into one malicious behaviour when using a wrong `Host` header? Like a cache?\n\nIf you can edit your first message, please remove the informations that are unique to you, like your session token—we tend to ask for the disclosure of all the reports we receive in order to be as transparent as possible.

I agree that you can poison a cache server and alter the behaviour of the application this way, but I don't get how you can do it for a browser. A PoC would be welcome because I think you're wrong there (mixing the notions of browser cache, DNS cache and cache server?).\n3.
