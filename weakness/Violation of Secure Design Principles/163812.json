The sentence about automated scans in our policy is more to avoid getting copied and pasted Acunetix reports (same with w3af, etc…). \n\n[As SSLLabs explain](https://blog.qualys.com/ssllabs/2013/09/10/is-beast-still-a-threat), the fix for BEAST is client-side and no good server-side fix exists (except enabling only RC4), thus they don't consider it's a real risk anymore. It's still enabled when using Mozilla's \"Intermediate profile\" too.\n\nI'm closing this report as \"Informative\" since no direct security risk is present.
