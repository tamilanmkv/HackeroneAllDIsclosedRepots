(I used www.attacker.com)\n4. Click on the email.\n5. Add the Victim's Email Id.\n6. Done. Email Sent to Victim with attacker's malicious site or phising page.\n\n**Impact:**\nUsing this vulnerability an attacker can use a malcious script or a phising page to trick the victims. Username of gratipay (In case of this report attacker's site) will be renders as a link. Victim Just need to click on that link. since the email is from trusted domain like gratipay.com, victim will definitely want to click on the link which could be end up to takeover his account etc.\n\n**Fix:** It can be fixed by do not allowing .

Since the content of the mail is verbose (\"We received a request to connect \u003cyourmail\u003e to the \u003cfake link\u003e account on Gratipay\") and there is a big green button, I don't think this is a good vector for phishing. In addition, I don't really see how you phish the user to take over his account since as far I know, one email can be used only once on Gratipay and you won't be able to send this message if the user already has one account. That's why I'm not categorizing this report as a security vulnerability, closing as \"Informative\".\n\nThank you for making Gratipay a safer place!
