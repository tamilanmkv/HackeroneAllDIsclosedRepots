You restricted it but sign-out still is an available username. \n\nLike gratipay have the directory listing for following:\nProfile, Giving , History, Emails, Routes, Settings.\n\nBut none of the above is restricted for use as an username.\n\nI created my account of three of above username for POC purpose. When User of gratipay will click on the following link, he would expect the history, sign-out, settings page of gratipay. But he will end up visiting my gratipay account. \n\n**POC:**\nhttps://gratipay.com/sign-out/\nhttps://gratipay.com/History/\nhttps://gratipay.com/settings/\n\n**Fix:** \nYou can fix most of this username restriction issues by not allowing . (dot) in username as i suggested in my previous report and other usernames without \".\" dot can be restricted explicitly.\n\nThanks,\nAkash Saxena","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":3,"voters":["spetr0x","akash_9021","ariyansarma"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1164060,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi Gratipay team,\nAnyone would give this report a look please??","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-31T07:02:24.274Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T07:02:24.274Z","actor":{"username":"akash_9021","cleared":false,"url":"/akash_9021","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1166197,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @password_change,\n\nThanks for this report and sorry for the delay, I was less active the last days.\n\nWe handled #128121 because it was somehow easy to trick an user: accessing `/sign-out.html` was different of `/sign-out.html/`, since the second one was redirecting to the page of an user. The layout of this page was different and you were very limited while displaying a phishing attempt, but we still categorized it as theoretical and issued a fix.\n\nHowever, we can't afford to blacklist all the \"technical\" words (`settings`, `sign-out`â€¦) just because somebody may use it: the list would be enormous and it's not a plausible security risk. It was fixed for the pages of top-level (`sign-out.html`...) but your report mentions pages of a sub-folder (in the case of `settings`, the profile of the user). `sign-out.html` was a real page, `sign-out` is not.\n\nI think the risk is too low to spend time on it: it's not only about forbidding dots, but all the existing pages, things looking like the brand name, \"win-a-lot-of-money\" and other similar words/sentences. That's why I'm categorizing this report as Infomative.\n\nThanks for making Gratipay a safer place!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-31T20:44:54.962Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T20:44:54.962Z","actor":{"username":"nashe_","cleared":false,"url":"/nashe_","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1166200,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"The report does not present a risk reasonable enough to be considered a security risk.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-31T20:46:02.434Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T20:46:02.434Z","actor":{"username":"nashe_","cleared":false,"url":"/nashe_","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1166201,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-08-31T20:46:09.830Z","updated_at":"2016-08-31T20:46:09.830Z","first_to_agree":true,"actor":{"username":"nashe_","cleared":false,"url":"/nashe_","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1169980,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ExternalUserJoined","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-09-02T15:49:11.277Z","updated_at":"2016-09-02T15:49:11.277Z","additional_data":{"duplicate_report_id":164955},"actor":{"username":"0xni8walk3r","cleared":false,"url":"/0xni8walk3r","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/tgGtf7CNUhH8FYDp2puozvxd/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1391896,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-12-30T07:46:36.393Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T07:46:36.393Z","actor":{"username":"akash_9021","cleared":false,"url":"/akash_9021","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1391897,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportBecamePublic","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2016-12-30T07:46:36.441Z","updated_at":"2016-12-30T07:46:36.441Z","actor":{"username":"akash_9021","cleared":false,"url":"/akash_9021","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gratipay","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false}],"activity_page_count":1,"activity_page_number":1,"summaries":[{"category":"team","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false},{"category":"researcher","can_view?":true,"can_create?":false}]}
