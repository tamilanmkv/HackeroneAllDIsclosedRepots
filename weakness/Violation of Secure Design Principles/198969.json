As you will see, I will be logged with user 2, then make burp requests to get all my reminders. User 2 will have 2 reminders. Then I will switch to user 3 in incognito and you can see that this user has just 1 reminder with another id. Then, from this user I will make a request to delete a reminder from user 2 just by passing the id. I will click this 2 times and after this, I will switch to user 2 and see that his reminder has been deleted by user 3. The users can be identified by the passes session id in the request and you will see this is different.\n","bounty_amount":"300.0","formatted_bounty":"$300","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-09-28T07:20:09.884Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-127377615.90818034,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":13,"voters":["jensec","bl4de","vijay_kumar","eveeez","r3y","mr_r3boot","bb00x","sh3r1","spetr0x","tkye","and 3 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"medium","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1424741,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Nice find!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-01-17T12:46:53.648Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T12:46:53.648Z","actor":{"username":"mheiland","cleared":false,"url":"/mheiland","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/425JKsXEnCYsDU1VA48SXXZV/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"open-xchange","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1424742,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Thanks for reporting this vulnerability to us.
