This domain is not registered. The actual flow does **not** include this domain, but I think it's confusing enough to consider the risk of someone mistakenly using the domain listed in the article (for example people that do not understand the *exempli gratia* abbreviation) \n\n{F173415}\n\nI am not entirely sure whether this would qualify as a security issue but I do think it is something you should consider fixing. The risk is low, but the impact is high (both the exposure of incoming security reports without them being forwarded to the actual vendor and a false credibility for the domain), and a fix would be rather easy to implement. \n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Register `security-h1-forward.com` for **[$1](https://www.godaddy.com)**\n2. Set up catch all e-mail forwarding to your e-mail address\n3. Wait for security reports to come in that are mistakenly send to the domain mentioned in the help article\n\nI'm aware of the fact that `support.hackerone.com` is excluded from the scope, but since it's not a vulnerability is the actual software itself, I thought it'd be OK to report it.\n\nBest regards,\n\n\nInti\n\n","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":173415,"file_name":"Screen_Shot_2017-04-05_at_11.38.18.png","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/173/415/a4c11a069babbf8ab83140f51f3db16e5fc1e95b/Screen_Shot_2017-04-05_at_11.38.18.png?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22Screen_Shot_2017-04-05_at_11.38.18.png%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Screen_Shot_2017-04-05_at_11.38.18.png\u0026response-content-type=image%2Fpng\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ7H6NCLCA%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T140611Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHUaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIBCjdoUai95GqoqRdZPvewVTGWTu7hW9M1xsEa2tnJ2wAiEApQcvVvkI%2BBsK0ecHviHNOIueIogzHcih4FNXbWCzeVkqgwQI7v%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDF%2BSeVXC33iyV8QWeSrXA1ssE%2FEGIWSZ%2FuRCd4oXxa0L1Lxp%2FgZ3zVMnFb3xAeki0kryhhssKmftZAynWR2Q1zaBR53gjdraq6wRyIKeaN10nGH%2BCzjURsH34KRC1TOwts5MYcloS6LERgqr1SpV%2B%2FyQzDTgT2kS7g6IE%2FPeoepcFFJMxl5IvtRGcabRXuEPLRYcxt7w6jKNei1awCDyq1irj02Z42QRBSTvkYgIOHYNLMFYX3E%2F0tFI1gV2NfcCmFszpeFyasntII3Gyw3H1an6BrUGChcOYIfu%2F1WTbUdNI%2Fpjmr10lpa6XlUtxFI9c0eKAVGXcoQ3EJHRTPyWcd6Gnq4TSlpHL0D54jaEQGHBDeDUxeA6DotTHBbroOpxOoq6S1nhZ0OMb3p%2BjXCBVueAHtDFqN%2Bnjx3qwjEEfRqnOUZVwu2AW7uQZCfC2vw4kynhx1t%2FbtkiC5KthO6jIzK1h%2FjH9uqYT0bwnLaiuJs7%2Fa0R8E%2FhplfGIzFmI%2BPPnknXwAmmWU9Xa%2Bm189leh9xBp6nNN7ufioFPFK77gl8s%2FXWhnHHRwfkQk2D0unemyL2YGJyVofMRhz7FlOLdoDcPt%2FVEvFBOEQOr5BaJlpQMGIbhI0gXAmjbeZwS3uck7lnUXN7N%2BDCB7ZCLBjqlASAOgKdryIO2D5AU3ejK49G6vrtKAglCcTf7cFkw0ROVtRedKGY3KUk5E3StqVBKZSdhowAIQjfqwiAkemJwzUJGbeun1p67EPamOv2EPpEqY6R88tB4ybHuSsWOJiykQnbihgfjANmR19lVcpFUZpvB6v00p8I6H%2F%2FUOjnFdoCXZkBX1hdc0Cr9U5xZqBbFVM8Hds5wc%2BboAR7bu67Z%2Fvqp9K%2BbZg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=f211b4224fd3c68b9fea1a44bbba034df6108fb5d8b42fd7815a1180a49cf780","file_size":164793,"type":"image/png"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2017-05-10T17:41:24.770Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-139523086.52467382,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":16,"voters":["delimitry","inhibitor181","sameerphad72","spam404","intidc","ysx","eveeez","r3y","its_afolic","t4ym","and 6 more..."],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":1588446,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Interesting report - I'll raise this internally and get back to you shortly!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-04-07T04:04:31.851Z","updated_at":"2017-04-07T04:04:31.851Z","actor":{"username":"asuka","cleared":false,"url":"/asuka","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/111/923/28e02b13f94679bbda8c7d3b7390776d8977f1b6_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":1589184,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Cool.
