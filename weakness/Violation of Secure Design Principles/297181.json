The `www.hackerone.com` being hosted on a third party, this can lead to private url information being passed to third party.    \n\n**Description**\n\nA `referrer policy` header is set on all pages including **/hacktivity** to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` wherein the full path of the url will be set as the `referer` only if the request is `same-origin`. But it was seen that although this header being set at /hacktivity page, it still sends a full url to an different origin ie `www.hackerone.com`. www.hackerone.com being hosted on a third party and also even after setting the referrer-policy header the hacktivity page sends full url in the referer header. This is something serious here. \n\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n+ Sign-in to hackerone.\n+ Start a web debugging proxy like burp to capture the request.\n+ Click on hacktivity tab -  https://hackerone.com/hacktivity. The url will contain filter parameters that are set default eg `https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular\u0026filter=type%3Aall\u0026page=1\u0026range=forever`. This is the `popular` hackivity page with default filters. capture the request and response. The response looks like this.\n\n\n```:status:                           200\ndate:                              Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:42:21 GMT\ncontent-type:                      text/html; charset=utf-8\ncache-control:                     private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\ncontent-disposition:               inline; filename=\"response.html\"\nx-request-id:                      d7905553-8780-4731-93b8-021b4761817a\nset-cookie:                        __Host-session=\u003cRedacted value\u003e; path=/; secure; HttpOnly\nstrict-transport-security:         max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload\nexpect-ct:                         enforce, max-age=86400\ncontent-security-policy:           \u003cRedacted as long for clarity\u003e\nreferrer-policy:                   strict-origin-when-cross-origin\nx-content-type-options:            nosniff\nx-download-options:                noopen\nx-frame-options:                   DENY\nx-permitted-cross-domain-policies: none\nx-xss-protection:                  1; mode=block\nserver:                            cloudflare-nginx\ncf-ray:                            3cbe5c199a952db5-BOM\ncontent-encoding:                  gzip```\n\n**Note** - If we look at the `referrer-policy:` header it is set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.\n\n+ Click on `blog` link at the bottom of the page and capture the request. The request looks like this. \n\n```:method:         GET\n:path:           /blog\n:authority:      www.hackerone.com\n:scheme:         https\nuser-agent:      Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0\naccept:          text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\naccept-language: en-US,en;q=0.5\naccept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nreferer:         https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular\u0026filter=type%3Aall\u0026page=1\u0026range=forever\ncookie:          \u003cRedacted cookie values\u003e\nif-none-match:   \"1513035467\"```\n\n**Note** - The `referer:` header contains the full url path inspite of referrer-policy header being set to strict-origin-when-cross-origin. This is a security violation as www.hackerone.com is not a `same-origin` and also hosted on a third party.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe hackivity url does not contain any private or hidden paths. But even after a strict header being set, this behaviour is a threat as it violates the policy. If a header is set, the policy must be followed and enforced. This is to be ensured for better security.","bounty_amount":"500.0","formatted_bounty":"$500","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2018-02-19T02:43:58.512Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-114954989.33689673,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":37,"voters":["jokebookservice1","muon4","flashdisk","mpz","muhammad_uwais","harry_mg","nitishshah","eveeez","r3y","whitesector","and 27 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","score":2.6,"author_type":"Team","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"high","privileges_required":"low","user_interaction":"required","scope":"unchanged","confidentiality":"low","integrity":"none","availability":"none"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2217577,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"The violation seems to exist at many more endpoints. \n\nThis includes sandboxed program settings pages -\n \n`https://hackerone.com/\u003cprogram name\u003e/edit` \n\nThis can reveal names of sandboxed programs.

I found one such scenario among the google analytics request. \n\nWhile trying to create a new `common response`,  an `accept path` is returned that contains `base64` of the already typed message \neg. if I typed `@aorta ?` as the message, the accept path returned would be as follows: \n\n`{\"accept_path\":\"/bigbug_test_hp00w/common_responses/new?message=QGFvcnRhID8%3D\"}`\n\n `QGFvcnRhID8%3D` is the base64 of `@aorta ?`. \n\nIt was seen that google analytics contains the full `accept path` as one of its parameters. \n\n`v=1\u0026_v=j66\u0026a=1727450351\u0026t=pageview\u0026_s=1\u0026dl=https%3A%2F%2Fhackerone.com%2Fbigbug_test_hp00w%2Fcommon_responses%2Fnew%3Fmessage%3DQGFvcnRhID8%253D\u0026dr=https%3A%2F%2Fhackerone.com%2Fbugs%3Fsubject%3Dbigbug_test_hp00w%26report_id%3D296709%26view%3Dnew%26substates%255B%255D%3Dnew%26reported_to_team%3D%26text_query%3D%26program_states%255B%255D%3D2%26program_states%255B%255D%3D3%26program_states%255B%255D%3D4%26program_states%255B%255D%3D5%26sort_type%3Dlatest_activity%26sort_direction%3Ddescending%26limit%3D25%26page%3D1\u0026ul=en-us\u0026de=UTF-8\u0026dt=Add%20Common%20Responses\u0026sd=24-bit\u0026sr=1525x858\u0026vp=1525x734\u0026je=1\u0026_u=SCCAAUAj~\u0026jid=1843720938\u0026gjid=712444887\u0026cid=814593961.1510427630\u0026uid=193109\u0026tid=UA-49905813-1\u0026_gid=1323093568.1512929475\u0026_r=1\u0026z=707970596` \n\nPlease have a look at the `dl` parameter - `dl=https%3A%2F%2Fhackerone.com%2Fbigbug_test_hp00w%2Fcommon_responses%2Fnew%3Fmessage%3DQGFvcnRhID8%253D`\n\nThis leaks the typed message in `message`  parameter in base64 format which is set as `common response`.\n\n**IMPACT**\n+ Thus common responses of programs are leaked to google analytics. \n+ This also happens to be private content of the reports that are typed.\nHence this is a private information leakage. Hope you consider this! \n\nthank you    ","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2017-12-14T11:29:04.847Z","updated_at":"2017-12-14T11:33:18.298Z","actor":{"username":"bigbug","cleared":false,"url":"/bigbug","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/193/109/585fd367d9fe6feb8fb35840fdadb04d16004b0b_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":2223547,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"@jobert Anything on this?
