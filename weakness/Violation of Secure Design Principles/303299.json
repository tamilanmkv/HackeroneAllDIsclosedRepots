But at our lovable platform \"Hackerone\" there is no Password Confirmation at one of very critical functions i.e Payout Method/state Change.\nAll the other important functions like : 1.) Email Change 2.) Password Change 3.) Disable Account are additionally protected by demanding the user to enter his current password to make any changes in them. \n\nBut to my dismay Payout Method requires no additional authorization to:\n 1.) Change state of any payout method, 2.) Add new payout method or 3.) Delete any. \n\nWhich is quite unexpected. Isn't it? \nOr shall we not consider this function critical enough (like email,password change etc.) to demand additional security practice?\n\nProof Of Concept:\nSTEP 1.) Visit the following link with a logged in researcher account:\n              https://hackerone.com/settings/payment_preferences\n\nSTEP 2.) Make any changes there. Notice you won't be asked to re-enter your password.\n\n\nVery keen to have your response\nHimanshu Kumar\n\n## Impact\n\nAll the critical functionalities are protected by issuing a password confirmation as an additional security practice so that even if some one gets access to some logged in session, they can't do much harm. This certainly is just a best practice to cover any unintended mistakes of some worthy users.\n\nThe issue is one the missing best practices like the following other reports:\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/242964\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/546\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/38343","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":7,"voters":["foobar7","mattberg","hk755a","japz","pwendelboe","dolph1n","dyabla"],"severity":{"rating":"medium","score":6.8,"author_type":"User","metrics":{"attack_vector":"network","attack_complexity":"low","privileges_required":"high","user_interaction":"none","scope":"changed","confidentiality":"none","integrity":"low","availability":"low"}},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2270355,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Hi @hk755a - thanks for the report.
