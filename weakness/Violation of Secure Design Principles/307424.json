On selecting paypal we are asked to add paypal email id. On saving new email id. A hackerone account holder (i.e account from which payout method was changed) gets a notification email  saying that \"The payout method was changed form current_user@testmail.com\" to \"New_user@testmail.com\"\n\nNote: This message comes when user has checked the box for making this email id as default else a simple notification email is triggered saying a new payment method has recently added to your account.\n\nThis is the expected behavior and very correct.\n\nBut the issue is a user whose email id has been added is not notified, according to me this is not the correct flow. Even a user should be notified that this email id has been added for paypal by xyz person. So all further payments will receive to this email id.\n\nAccording to me the idle behaviour should be like whenever a user enters a new email address a verification code should be sent to that email address and after verifying only that email should be allowed. This is what i think and i believe.\n\nNow a question arises why anyone will enter any other person email address because its all about money.\n\nBut the answer is you never know what an attacker might be thinking. There may be n number of reasons doing this below are few\n\n1. On receiving bounty end user will be confused from where did this amount got deposited i never reported any vulnerability nor i have account on hackerone then y money got deposited to my account and may be he can lodge a complaint.\n\n2. Purposely deposit money money to make him pay more tax (i don't know abt other countries but in country like INDIA if money is coming from additional resource then Accountants asks for all proofs from where did money came and we need to show all of them and based on that we pay yearly taxes)\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Login into your hackerone account\n2. Goto Settings -\u003e Payment Methods -\u003e click on add payment method\n3. Add another email id for which you have access ( so that you can check for any notification emails) \n4.Save\n\nYou will notice notification emails are only triggered to your registered hackerone account and no notification email is sent to newly added account.\n\n### Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)\n Works in all browsers \n\n### Optional: Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)\n\n I have there is no need for any screenshots above steps are sufficient to reproduce it.\n\nNote: This mentioned issue is not a hack but it is a good practise and adding a verification for new email id would be defence in depth.\n\n## Impact\n\nAs mentioned above an attacker can use this in any way. We cannot guess what an attacker might think.","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":8,"voters":["bl4de","khizer47","cr4xerbik4sh","a8eight","dyabla","thetroubledone","benurr-sa23","dave89"],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"User"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":3,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"https://hackerone.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2303599,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugInformative","message":"Hi,\n\nThank you for your submission.

So i request you to read above report once again please. \n\nSince you are looking into this report i will again try to explain once again.\n\nHere me as an attacker is able to add anyone's email id in payout method (paypal) irrespective of victim is a hackerone registered member or not .\n\nFor example on selecting payment method as paypal i can add new email id as Victim@gmail.com but here victim is aware that i have set his email id for receiving payment.\n\nHere at 1st point hackerone is directly allowing to add any email id without verifying nor hackerone is notifying that person via email.\n\nNow lets see impact\n\n@jobert here we are doing a setting change which has something to do with money and whenever there is some change related to payments both accounts should be notified.\n\nIf me as an attacker wants some legal action or penalty for Victim@gmail.com i can set payment method to his email id. As already stated in countries like india income tax laws has become very strict, if a person does not show his total income while paying taxes their is a huge penalty.\n\nSo this is how i think notifying a newly added email id (for payment method) is must. I believe whatever i have said is correct and valid.  I hope you will read both (my initial submission and this revert) once again.\n\n@jobert now regarding public disclosure: If you think this is not a valid point and you are not going to fix then why not to disclose it because according to me its valid.
