Generally invited programs are only accessible to certain users based on reputation system. \n\nNow, for most public programs the username of the program remains same as program name, that is for Slack's program it is *slack*, for Square it is *square*. So my finding to enumerate works like the following (taking example of **████** invitation only program):\n\n████ program is located at https://hackerone.com/████, but it is only accessible to invited users else if an uninvited user visits the page he gets a 404 error, that's sweet. Isn't it ?\n\nBut using the following logic: \n\nhttps://hackerone.com/████/common_responses.json (500 Internal Server Error)\nhttps://hackerone.com/████/common_responses.json (500 Internal Server Error)\nhttps://hackerone.com/trololol/common_responses.json (404 Not Found)\n\nBased on the responses we can understand that for every existing program (public/invited) the server throws 500 error code but for non-existent program it throws 404 error code. So someone who wants to guess if a company is there in the invited program simply needs to send the following request (assuming company name is same as username, as it is currently in most of the cases at HackerOne):\n\nhttps://hackerone.com/\u003ccompany-name-here\u003e/common_responses.json (500 if exists or 404 if it doesn't, then if the username is not in any of the public program then surely it will be in invited program :-) )\n\nThis thing can be automated with a list of company names as potential usernames.\n\nThanks,\nPrakhar Prasad\n","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2015-06-08T00:27:05.875Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-200240370.46438873,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":3,"voters":["madrobot","spetr0x","dyabla"],"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":149394,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugDuplicate","message":"Great find, but you've unfortunately stumbled across a duplicate Won't Fix of an intentional design decision and it's something that has been submitted to us before.
