Non-pie-binaries are loaded to a fixed location, thus allowing ROP attacks.\n\nI'm aware that technically this is not a vulnerability, but a lack of a hardening feature. However given that ASLR is generally considered standard practice these days and that lack of it can mean very simple bugs can directly lead to code execution I think it deserves to be fixed.\n\n## Impact\n\nA simple memory corruption bug like a buffer overflow can easily lead to a remote code execution bug. With ASLR these bugs are much harder and sometimes impossible to exploit.","bounty_amount":"100.0","formatted_bounty":"$100","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design Principles"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-11-17T12:44:46.336Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-59969593.85851794,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":47,"voters":["mashoud1122","bl4de","sameerphad72","mik317","ali","khizer47","exception","codeanddecode","canardmandarin","fanar","and 37 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"low","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":null,"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":3403811,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugTriaged","message":"Triaged!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-09-28T21:01:06.679Z","updated_at":"2018-09-28T21:01:06.679Z","actor":{"username":"fyunaz","cleared":false,"url":"/fyunaz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6039835,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2019-10-15T01:04:40.078Z","updated_at":"2019-10-15T01:04:40.078Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Medium","new_severity":"Low","old_severity_id":215793,"new_severity_id":538720},"actor":{"username":"brandenjordan","cleared":false,"url":"/brandenjordan","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/bgbCe4uKdAiLL3PwUabXTgWP/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"slack","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":6039842,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BountyAwarded","message":"Hello @hanno!\n\nAppreciate your report here as well as your patience on the bounty payout.
