@japz - thanks for bringing this to our attention, this is a great find!\n\nThe other report you filed (#419288) has the same root cause as this issue. To help you understand why, and for the sake of defaulting to disclosure, let me give you some insight into how this endpoint works. The endpoint that dispatches the request, `:uuid/embedded_submissions`, to create a report through an embedded form looks like this:\n\n```ruby\ndef execute\n  # ...\n  report = Interactors::Reports::Create.interact_without_authorization(\n    report_attributes.merge(as_user: current_user),\n  )\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nWhen the `interact_without_authorization` method is used instead of `interact`, the ACL check is skipped. The ACL check for the `Interactors::Reports::Create` class looks like this:\n\n```ruby\ndef can_create_report?\n  return_false_if { !current_user }\n  return_false_if { current_user.reached_abuse_create_limit?(team: team) }\n  return_false_if { current_user.reached_team_signal_limit?(team: team, track_intent: true) }\n  return_false_if do\n    team.submission_requirements\u0026.mfa_required_at.present? \u0026\u0026\n      current_user.totp_supported? \u0026\u0026 current_user.totp_disabled?\n  end\n  can_create_draft?\nend\n\ndef can_create_draft?\n  # ...\n  return_false_if { team.blacklisted_reporters.include? current_user }\n  # ...\nend\n```\n\nAs you can see, this ACL check contains logic to make sure that the user isn't blacklisted and has 2FA enabled when the program requires it. We should've used `interact` instead of `interact_without_authorization`, which is why the fix (and root cause) of both of your reports is the same.\n\n**One more thing...**\n\nI also want to point out something else: when we did the root cause analysis of your report, we stumbled upon another security vulnerability. This security vulnerability has a higher severity than the issues you reported to us. Because you gave us a nudge in the right direction, we'll still go ahead and reward you for it. Here's the problem:\n\nAnonymous submissions are tracked through something we call a `tracer` identifier. This is a universally unique identifier (UUID) that we use to make sure you can't access other anonymous reporters' drafts and submissions. When any system submits a report through us, they submit a `draft_id`, which identifies the report draft for that particular report. It contains a copy of the title, vulnerability information, attachments, and more. Here's the code how we fetch report drafts in the `Interactors::Reports::Create` class:\n\n```ruby\ndef report_draft\n  if current_user\n    ReportDraft.find_by(id: draft_id, reporter: current_user, team: team)\n  else\n    ReportDraft.find_by(id: draft_id, tracer: tracer, team: team)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIf the user is authenticated, we try and find the report draft based on the given `draft_id` and the owner of the report draft. In case the user isn't authenticated, we use the tracer and `draft_id`. When an authenticated user creates a report draft, the tracer is left blank (`nil`). When we create a report as an anonymous user, the request looks like this:\n\n```\nPOST /█████/embedded_submissions HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:8080\n...\n\n----------1446553971\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"draft_id\"\n\n1\n----------1446553971\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"tracer\"\n\n█████████\n----------1446553971\n...\n----------1446553971--\n```\n\nWhen you submit it as an authenticated user, the `tracer` isn't submitted because we identify the user based on the `current_user` object. This means that the `tracer` parameter is optional. The code also shows this:\n\n**Controller**\n```ruby\ndef create\n  # ...\n  report = Interactors::Reports::CreateEmbeddedSubmission.interact(\n    draft_id: report_params[:draft_id],\n    # ...\n    tracer: report_params[:tracer],\nend\n\n# ...\n\ndef report_params\n  params.require(:report)\n  report_params = params.permit(\n    # ...\n    tracer: Parameters.string,\n    draft_id: Parameters.id | Parameters.nil,\n    # ...\n    ),\n  )\n\n  report_params[:report].merge(\n    draft_id: report_params[:draft_id],\n    handle: report_params[:team_id],\n    tracer: report_params[:tracer],\n  )\nend\n```\n\nThis is where the problem arises: if an anonymous user removes the `tracer` parameter from the request, it'll fall back to a `nil` value. This means that the `report_draft` method (as shown earlier) will be executed with a tracer equal to the tracer that is used for authenticated users, resulting in an anonymous user being able to load report drafts from authenticated users who have drafts for the same program.\n\nWhen we create the report, we fetch the attachments from the report draft. When you're creating a draft, the attachments are attached to that object and so we need to move them to the new report object. The following code is then executed:\n\n```ruby\ndef valid_attachments\n  attachments.where(attachable: report_draft).or(attachments.where(attachable: nil))\nend\n```\n\nThe `attachments` method looks like this:\n\n```ruby\ndef attachments\n  return Attachment.none if attachment_ids.empty?\n\n  if current_user\n    Attachment.where(id: attachment_ids, uploaded_by: current_user)\n  elsif report_draft\n    Attachment.where(id: attachment_ids, attachable: report_draft)\n  else\n    fail(\n      'cannot safely get attachments without current user and without report_draft',\n    )\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe vulnerability that is caused by this, is that an anonymous user can load a report draft from another user, which was authenticated when creating the draft. The attachments of that draft are then copied to the anonymous submission, thus allowing you to \"steal\" someone's attachments.\n\nThere are two caveats to this: you do not immediately get access to the attachments. Anonymous submissions can't be claimed right now. However, I'd think that if would follow up with the program or with our support channel, we'd allow you to claim the report after the fact, granting you access to the attachments you were not authorized to see. The other caveat is that this only applies to attachments of drafts created for the same program, the program needs to have an embedded submission form, and you need to have the embedded submission form's UUID. All in all, it would grant you access to someone else's attachments though, which is not good.\n\nThanks again for bringing this to our attention, this was a good find! We will escalate this to the team and will start working on a fix for both problems.

This security vulnerability has a higher severity than the issues you reported to us. Because you gave us a nudge in the right direction, we'll still go ahead and reward you for it.\n\nFirst, thank you for the very detailed explanation about the relationship of the bug that i've submitted and the other bug you found because of my submission. I've read everything and try to understand from to bottom of your comments. From what i understand, the other high severity bug you found while you guys doing the Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is the attacker can steal sensitive report details such as `Attachments` if attacker manipulates the __anonymous__ submission request and removed the `tracer` param from the request because it will load the drafts reports from authenticated users whos doing embedded submission drafts in the same program.\n\nI'm glad i was able to help and put the team in the right direction that will eliminates the other high severity issue.\n\n\u003eRegarding my earlier comment:\n\n \u003e\u003eyou do not immediately get access to the attachments. Anonymous submissions can't be claimed right now.\n\n\u003eThis turns out to be false. A user has the ability to provide their email address when they make an anonymous submission. This will send them an invitation to claim the report. When they do so, they'll immediately gain access to the attachment.\n\nYes that's correct, i tested the `authenticated` and `anonymous` submission before i submitted my report, and the anonymous submission will let you claim the report by sending an invite to accept the report if your provided email address in the form have an existing account on HackerOne  :)\n\n\u003e\u003eThanks again for bringing this to our attention, this was a good find! We will escalate this to the team and will start working on a fix for both problems. Good luck and happy hacking!\n\nIt's my pleasure working with you guys as always :)\n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2018-10-06T05:05:34.408Z","updated_at":"2018-10-06T05:10:20.865Z","actor":{"username":"japz","cleared":false,"url":"/japz","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/078/347/38b576ad263c5255e136ebbd3a19eb61ff7a298d_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":3442517,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"HI @jobert \n\n\u003eabout an hour ago we released a fix for the security vulnerability that we found ourselves. \n\nI'll probably take a look at this one after both issues was fully resolved :)\n\nWe're still in the process of getting a fix out for your initial report.

This vulnerability was awarded $2,500.\n\nWhen we looked into the root cause of the vulnerability, we stumbled upon another vulnerability, which had a higher CVSS score (7.1). The second vulnerability that we identified allowed an attacker to gain access to other users' attachments who were writing a report at the same time. Because we identified this vulnerability due to @japz' report, we decided to award him an additional $7,500.
