Currently I see all the screenshots uploaded are stored in Amazon S3 bucket \"hackerone-attachments\" and by default HTTPS connection is made. However even HTTP connections are open to these URLs indicating that SSL is not enforced by HackerOne on these buckets.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1. Submit a vulnerability on any program and upload a screenshot. \r\n2. The URL of the screenshot looks like this:\r\nhttps://hackerone-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/production/\u003csome_unique_path\u003e/\u003cfilename\u003e\r\n3.
