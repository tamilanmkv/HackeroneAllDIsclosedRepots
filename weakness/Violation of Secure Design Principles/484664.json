Missing quarantine attribute for downloaded files allows a remote attacker to send an executable file that won't be checked by Gatekeeper on victim's machine.\n\n2. Launching downloaded executable files without `com.apple.quarantine` meta-attribute won't show an alert about launching an executable file from the remote.\n\n3. Summarizing this: opening of a downloaded executable file immediately leads to code execution bypassing Quarantine(files from remote) \u0026 GateKeeper(codesign).\n\n\u003e Tip: check `com.apple.quarantine` meta-attribute with \"xattr\" util\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n1. Attacker sends `exploit.terminal` to the victim (file can't be signed)\n2. Victim opens `exploit.terminal` file\n3. No alert from Gatekeeper about unsigned executable\n4. No alert about running executable file downloaded from the web\n5. Shell commands from `exploit.terminal` get executed immediately after click.\n\n### .terminal\n1. `.terminal` files can't be signed but could lead to code execution. \n2. Disabled quarantine allows attacker to abuse this flaw and decrease required user interaction from `download archive -\u003e unpack archive -\u003e open something from archive` to `download file -\u003e launch file`.\n3.  Download\u0026Launch is a common user flow, because macOS doesn't have any executable files which could lead to immediate code execution. macOS users generally feel safe about opening files.\n\n\u003e Also, `.terminal` files are just a plain XML, so it can't be detected by most antivirus/EDR software.\n\nActual result - Files downloaded through ICQ should have `com.apple.quarantine` meta attribute.\nExpected result - Files downloaded through ICQ don't have `com.apple.quarantine` meta attribute.\n\n## Additional info\n\n `exploit.terminal` file attached to this report (`echo \"Hello\" \u0026\u0026 id`)\n\n## Impact\n\n1. Downloaded through ICQ executable files bypass Quarantine/GateKeeper. \n2. `.terminal` files shorten required user interaction to  ~2 clicks.\n\nAdditional impact - code execution happens even in environments hardened with \"Apps from AppStore only\" GateKeeper setting.","bounty_amount":"150.0","formatted_bounty":"$150","weakness":{"id":73,"name":"Phishing"},"original_report_id":null,"original_report_url":null,"attachments":[{"id":411164,"file_name":"exploit.terminal","expiring_url":"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/411/164/f1e89bcc6abcf4c1fb969c626afceff9a7498001/exploit.terminal?response-content-disposition=attachment%3B%20filename%3D%22exploit.terminal%22%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27exploit.terminal\u0026response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream\u0026X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256\u0026X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQXEQ3VCGF%2F20211011%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request\u0026X-Amz-Date=20211011T150451Z\u0026X-Amz-Expires=3600\u0026X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHYaCXVzLXdlc3QtMiJHMEUCIQCNbr25hK1JC2i73IX5uE08m1agZwA%2BCyxTPtXmxpZHFAIgA9v21iU9rOtKWjxfMHo7kqQOL4Y8ABbAnucRVLpaC9cqgwQI7%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARACGgwwMTM2MTkyNzQ4NDkiDOyim%2FBwzSkIWBPCWirXA1TUfPlTIAz6iDfoaiiMP8hivTDD8uDyRJ%2FoAF5UW%2F6cSrWHj2Mtt%2Fx8tKTYSGoQiyhUdi%2BFdxLY35ZRGqE5k10GcpBa5q9ivBUHzTLtIbzvkVLjo0GDs33RjPyv8lT8%2BIT3cR1GpHz5sKugzk1wJHpaXHIGV7TsNZTez5PsxRWLAbodD46%2Bv0aY9dXICvo8Bld1OIiDoUsI3sX2R7SAEjL0B45opfmY7Hh4KKVF9KyCf7etmcGEL0U%2Bjij5TfmuHRxoVJXFKR4WbBKoHXN3cL5AQhAkGBE5bmE6cTsvfhMkCltMfmR1OmQtt1QK7fs2YWSyJhNNnjgzseVzroJk8qcktNvGQQNtmAz%2F0hi%2BbLDdR3r35MBTZtRPxGxwfYKfk%2Blyikhar%2F%2FfPxr6sJoQhbcKSjiziR8cFwFPC97f3qfgH6sVJVvH5AClhLDj9FMqequ01uI1FMQI%2BQ1BJ1t%2Bl3dX7D09OZCMRrk3HvidiN7al4fmx5e0pKMz7tbb23gSzvgiMJbXeHgATiARA8dz6JIoLosFubesB7ZLWq9owsMVaP42CuihB%2Br9J9vu1HkgY4lcWvgRt8bqCjXjWDPBzlNcnc9D32bMJUDfp2BWdJ0BCnpEi4XjrDCyiJGLBjqlAbw%2BQzzkBo5pgpwg2B9K3Kb9khz80zQhxWTR4UFlyZpApeXe135MxtRrVWf1VeEC8qBZynSiicNEE5qSEPmd%2FKNSihzfYJ9PmbUkfZN9yFsrIArapjiCpWMywbnOVNeLSHMFFv8xtfh0sOTI4VetTtHS5BxyHny%2BvnXM6Hjudg5tfOAvbwkv9j%2BTfq0Y0YGFWvyUNrCeX3Y3zQ5t8ked%2FqOvxUSYeg%3D%3D\u0026X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host\u0026X-Amz-Signature=9eea1b33f15c2c36fdfe08abe05b63ac0acc934e3fa28fae159184bb8da4fb4d","file_size":461,"type":"application/xml"}],"allow_singular_disclosure_at":"2019-10-11T19:42:41.280Z","allow_singular_disclosure_after":-63141730.20310036,"singular_disclosure_allowed":true,"vote_count":18,"voters":["danila","sameerphad72","spam404","ali","metnew","theappsec","cryptographer","sh04v","ktnano","blinkdagger","and 8 more..."],"severity":{"rating":"none","author_type":"Team"},"structured_scope":{"databaseId":42797,"asset_type":"OTHER","asset_identifier":"ICQ","max_severity":"critical"},"abilities":{"assignable_team_members":[],"assignable_team_member_groups":[]},"activities":[{"id":4024490,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"\u003e IMPORTANT: only ICQ from the official website is affected.
