This is a nice finding, but unfortunately this isn't something we're going to fix right now. We have built this proxy as a service for people to open a Factlink on a website that has no build-in Factlink support. The warning is just an additional sign that you're visiting that website through a proxy.\n\nThanks again for reporting this and happy hacking!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2015-04-30T05:22:35.347Z","updated_at":"2015-04-30T05:22:35.347Z","actor":{"username":"martijn","cleared":false,"url":"/martijn","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/5sJxxikBF7fwfkWs531JPtef/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"factlink","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":394876,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"I understand.
