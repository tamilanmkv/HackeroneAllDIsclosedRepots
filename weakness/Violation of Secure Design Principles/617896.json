Summary\nThe salesforce login integration allows attacker to bypass email verification -- user is able to signup with any email domain they want, effectively bypass all email domain whitelist/blacklist restriction or any other 3rd party using gitlab instance's email address.\n\nIt is possible because salesforce allow admin to create user with arbitrary email, and I believe this is what gitlab engineer forgot to consider while implementing salesforce integration.\n\nPlease follow along to see how I was able to create an account `███████` in gitlab.com\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n- Visit https://bugcrowd-ngalog-3.oktapreview.com/\n- Enter creds `██████████`:`██████████`\n- Click salesforce to login salesforce\n- Open new tab and visit https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in\n- Click login with salesforce\n- you will be logged in as `████` by visiting `https://gitlab.com/profile/emails`\n\n\n\n### Impact\nBypass email domain restriction
