seems one is able to upload arbitrary files to Amazon Webservices through the UI.\r\n\r\nThis allows for uploading malware such as

the filename to look more innocent, general human errors, a certain trust in files being served from `hackerone-attachments.*.amazonaws.com` or separate issues entirely.\r\n\r\nI could imagine this to

Leander - this is a report that we've received many times before and we've mostly treated them as a won't fix. \n\nThe arbitrary file upload angle is fully intentional, because it's purpose is providing researchers \u0026 response teams with a secure way of storing proof of concepts, so they don't have to use less predictable file storage services like Dropbox, Google Drive, SkyDrive etc.\n\nWe expect response teams to be super careful with downloading anything, and we intentionally do not serve content inline. We do a forced download and leave it up to the actual user \u0026 their operating system to warn for potential dangerous content or malicious intent. We even hear from some response teams that they exclusively run PoCs in a completely sandboxed VM, physically segregated from the corporate network.\n\nMain reason not to do a redirect interstitial here, is that it breaks the \"Save link as\" option that many browsers offer. This is a shortcut used by many response teams that use our site. We may revisit this decision in the future, for instance by adding some client-side UX that prevent downloading unless you state you understand the risk, but for now we consider this a won't fix.\n\nThanks!","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-04-20T13:07:16.384Z","updated_at":"2014-04-20T13:07:16.384Z","actor":{"username":"michiel","cleared":true,"url":"/michiel","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/000/007/439427fb81f710e5e16246ede1828613d46bb79e_original.png/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":true},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":true,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":39330,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Interesting that it does seem to be fixed now. \n\nThe page at https://hackerone.com says:\n\n`Exercise caution when opening attachments as they may be accompanied by unintentional consequences`\n\nCheers.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2014-04-26T19:25:05.591Z","updated_at":"2014-04-26T19:25:05.591Z","actor":{"username":"leander","cleared":false,"url":"/leander","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/000/004/627/31b99e478bdc5b23c3284c58c9612a43a9acc4be_original.jpg/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":false},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"security","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":39334,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::AgreedOnGoingPublic","message":"Requesting public disclosure to have the rationale documented.
