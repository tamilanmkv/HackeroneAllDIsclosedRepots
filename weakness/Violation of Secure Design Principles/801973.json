User logs in to gitlab.com using his email ID ( ex. user-one@gmail.com)\n2. Now, on https://gitlab.com/profile, user updates the login email id (\"Email\" field having \"We also use email for avatar detection if no avatar is uploaded\" written below it) to another email id (ex. user-two@gmail.com)\n3. Now, an email will go to user-one@gmail.com informing that email change action is being done. This is as expected. (Email subject : \"Email Changed\")\n4. Now, broken scenarios is as follows :\n5. On https://gitlab.com/profile/emails, user adds new email address (ex. user-three@gmail.com).\n6. user-one@gmail.com will receive email to confirm the newly added email by clicking on confirmation link received in new email.\n7. So, one new email id i.e. user-three@gmail.com will be seen as verified under https://gitlab.com/profile/emails,\n8. Now if we try to update login email id on https://gitlab.com/profile (as in step 2 above) to user-three@gmail.com, no email with subject as \"Email Changed\" will be received on user-one@gmail.com.\n\n\n### Impact\n\n1. Account primary owner will not be aware of the fact that owner has been changed to some other email id. Although, new email is verified, \"Email Changed\" email will be expected by account primary owner as this happens usually (as happened in step 3 in steps above). So, consistency is not maintained in informing new changes to account primary owner.\n\n### What is the expected *correct* behavior?\n\nI think there should be consistency in informing these critical account changes to account owner. \"Email Changed\" email is received by owner when unverified email is added. Similar should happen for verified email as body of this email is playing important role here to inform account owner of what changes happened.\n\n### Output of checks\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\n#### Results of GitLab environment info\nThis bug happens on GitLab.com\n\nAttached are the POC screenshots.\nPlease let me know if you need a video POC.\n\n## Impact\n\nAccount owner will not be aware that login email id for the gitlab account has been changed to one of the linked email id.","weakness":{"id":57,"name":"Violation of Secure Design

If there happens any CSRF on https://gitlab.com/profile, then it would lead to user account takeover and Primary owner will miss the \"Email Changed\" security notification. But I checked, there is no CSRF issue exist. But if it happen in future, it would be a risk.\n2. As per the gitlab documentation, https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/notifications.html#notification-events , the \"Email Changed\" notification is received always. However, with scenario depicted in report, notification is not received. \n3. The documentation does not say the Email Changed notification will not be received in this special case. So, user will be in a state that he would receive the notification always. \n4. Important : After we add any linked email on https://gitlab.com/profile/emails, the primary owner do not receive any notification email. Only the newly added email will get confirmation instruction to confirm the email.\nAnd considering the special case mentioned in this bug report, \"Email Changed\" email will also not be received by primary owner. So, this means primary owner will not get any kind of notification for adding new email and making it primary owner.\n\nIn short, this happens to be a gap in properly notifying the user about the email change which seems to be critical notification and needs a fix (Either in documentation specifying the special case Or in code so as to receive the notification always as the documentation says).\n\nThank you. \n\n","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-02-25T02:48:59.544Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T02:48:59.544Z","actor":{"username":"shaileshpratapwar","cleared":false,"url":"/shaileshpratapwar","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/QKrhVLZcYnidFgL9Nxhi9rYM/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7143155,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @shaileshpratapwar,\n\nThank you for this analysis.\n\nAs no exploitable scenario has been identified, we plan to consider this report as `Informative` and import it as a bug with no current security impact (process documented in the Disclosure section of https://hackerone.com/gitlab).\nHence we are updating the Severity to None.\n\nDo not hesitate to come back to us should we have misunderstood something.\nWe also offer you the possibility to self-close this report within the next 3 days.\n\nBest regards,\nGitLab Security Team","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-02-25T09:28:16.785Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T09:28:16.785Z","actor":{"username":"jmatos_bgtvf","cleared":false,"url":"/jmatos_bgtvf","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7143157,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::ReportSeverityUpdated","message":"","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-02-25T09:28:23.293Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T09:28:23.293Z","additional_data":{"old_severity":"Low (3.3)","new_severity":"None","old_severity_id":640111,"new_severity_id":642614},"actor":{"username":"jmatos_bgtvf","cleared":false,"url":"/jmatos_bgtvf","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7144796,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::BugNotApplicable","message":"Thank you.","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-02-25T10:39:30.471Z","updated_at":"2020-02-25T10:39:30.471Z","actor":{"username":"shaileshpratapwar","cleared":false,"url":"/shaileshpratapwar","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"https://profile-photos.hackerone-user-content.com/variants/QKrhVLZcYnidFgL9Nxhi9rYM/fd4ecbe1e3e98c343c7717114485ace2f830f9253103d3cfa7502059868c516c"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7153976,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hello @shaileshpratapwar,\n\nThank you for closing the report.\nFor transparency, here is the link to the public bug report: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/208130\n\nBest regards,\nGitLab Security Team","automated_response":false,"created_at":"2020-02-26T10:09:20.540Z","updated_at":"2020-02-26T10:09:20.540Z","actor":{"username":"jmatos_bgtvf","cleared":false,"url":"/jmatos_bgtvf","profile_picture_urls":{"medium":"/assets/avatars/default-71a302d706457f3d3a31eb30fa3e73e6cf0b1d677b8fa218eaeaffd67ae97918.png"},"hackerone_triager":false,"hackerone_employee":null},"genius_execution_id":null,"team_handle":"gitlab","actor_is_team_member":false,"actor_is_concealed_member":false},{"id":7255284,"is_internal":false,"editable":false,"type":"Activities::Comment","message":"Hi @jmatos_bgtvf \nSorry to buzz again but I noticed the \"Email Changed\" email is considered as a security email in the documentation link above.\nIts also written that it is \"sent always\".
