The way that the Hackerone application is configured/designed will cause IE to send auth cookies to all subdomains. If all the subdomains are controlled by you now and in the future, this may not be an issue. But, if any of the subdomains point to third-parties, they would be receiving auth cookies as well because of the way IE is designed. Any malicious third-party could log into hackerone using a stolen cookie associated with someone's user account. Basically, auth cookies will be leaked to parties that are not under your control.\n\nRecommendation:\n\n1. Upload files to a separate domain as mentioned by you.\n2. Host your site on www.hackerone.com instead of hackerone.com to prevent IE from leaking cookies to sub-domains.
